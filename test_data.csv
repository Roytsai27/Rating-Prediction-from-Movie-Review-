All the food I've had there has been decent and the prices aren't bad either.  This is a gay friendly restaurant so it's a good place to consider for a same-sex date.  It's also a good place for large groups.",2009-01-04
4734,1014,3521,"Wow!
Being a Phoenix native, we have enjoyed many a meals at the hands of Chef Gross. But this past weekend I was blown away.

I was planning a large garden party for my friends bridal shower. The record temperatures left my garden ravaged by the heat and I did not want to have sweltering ladies unable to enjoy themselves. After a small response to attendance, I decided to see what some of my favorite dining spots could offer me.

I had a small budget but wanted to keep it classy. Christopher's truly rose to the occasion. Alex, was my special event contact and this lady was ""on it"". Emails and phone calls were returned at lightning speed. She presented a delightful menu with plenty of choices (some even for the vegetarians attending) all with in my price range. 

We had a wonderful time. We had a party of 18 in the beautiful private room that fit our festivities perfectly. Sundays can be quiet at The Biltmore Fashion Park so it lend-ed us to a bit of intimacy that was nice. Ben was our go to guy. He was right there for every thing we needed and his helpers were polite and attentive.
As for the food, well, it's Chris, come on! I had the vegetable risotto ans  it was cooked to perfection. All of the plates came out of the kitchen quickly and all together but no one ever made us feel rushed. Wine flowed, desserts were gobbled up and the ladies oohed and awed over everything. the staff even offered to take gifts to the car for the bride.

Thanks for saving me Chef Chris and your team. You were all fabulous and I will be telling all of my friends what a great job you did. The holidays are coming and Ben reminded us that they also do catering! Hmmm, can you say ""Christmas Party""?",2010-10-05
5598,2939,3028,"Jodi is fantastic!  Extraordinary!  After too many expensive yet less-than-average salon expereinces, my hair has been less beautiful than its potential.  Jodi gave me a very thorough consultation after I did some research to find the best colorist for me.  During my appointment, Jodi was professional, efficient and friendly.  I left the salon with soft, gorgeous hair... lovely color, care of the INOA line, and I felt beautiful again.  She did what at least half a dozen other highly recommended colorists did not accomplish.  I'm ecstatic and relieved and I have finally found my colorist.  What more can a girl ask?  Thanks so much, Jodi.",2011-04-29
9545,4077,6200,"T&S Glass did a wonderful job replacing my car window. They came right to the house within 2 hours of my call, had the window replaced within 30 minutes and treated me like a queen. Frank installed the glass and couldn't have been nicer. Thank you T & S Glass!!",2007-10-02
1471,1126,1268,"My experience was on a random Saturday afternoon, and I think that might skew my opinion a bit.

During my visit we were the only guests dining.  There was one guy at the bar that was friends with the employees.  

The atmosphere is mellow.  And I can imagine it being a pretty happening place on weekend evenings.

The prices were a bit high for what we ate.  I had a pita sandwich and it was just under $10.  The lunch prices are a bit steep.

The food was okay, but nothing I'd go back time and time again for.",2010-08-16
4533,1284,3196,"I waited months before finally getting around to coming here, and it wasn't all I had hoped for. Went for my birthday, and got the garlic bread appetizer, wasn't very good and got crumbs all over the table. It had an odd burnt taste. Got the mushroom and steak calzone, which was huge and filling, but very greasy and took a long time to actually get to the table. They claimed it was the Hoagie that one of my friends had that took so long, but it shouldn't take so long to cook a sandwich. Either way, delicious, but nothing too special for the price. I won't likely return here, since some of my friends don't like this place.",2011-12-30
7723,3598,5252,"I was in Phoenix for three weeks on a business trip and luckily found this spot on my 3rd day in town.  I ended up eating here 7 times in 21 days.  I brought my coworkers here, and they all ended up eating here at least 2-3 times.  It's just that good.

So how good is it?  Lets just say that their tortilla soup was the only thing that could cure my horrible hangover after a long night in Scottsdale!

I've eaten the fish tacos, fajitas, enchiladas, nachos, and tortilla soup.  All were exceptional!  They also bring out chips with salsa, as well as beans, which was a nice touch.

The dining area is fairly small, but they do have an outside dining area as well.  The wait staff is very friendly, and they will get you drinks as soon as you sit down, which is something that more restaurants should do!  The food comes out very quickly, and they do have 2 TVs, one on either side of the dining room, which are usually tuned to a sporting event.

I've been out of Phoenix for 3 months now and I miss Mi Pueblo!  I'll definitely be going back the next time that I'm in Phoenix!",2011-01-25
2433,404,1021,I work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon. I ordered a salad to go. As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didn't. I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow. Very disappointed. $6+ bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers. I ordered a salad thinking I was getting something like the picture on their website. I won't be returning here. I'll be passing on lunch next time the co-workers opt for this place.,2011-03-14
9182,2200,1231,"I really enjoy That's A Wrap... all of the food I've ordered here has been really enjoyable, plus it's all a really good value for the money. My favorite wrap here is the Prince of Thai, sin pollo con tofu. The Veggie Bowl is also another good option and I'm pleased they can make anything vegetarian. Worth a stop for lunch, however, the parking lot is tight and I have been here more than once when it was full.",2008-06-05
2238,1555,1857,"Sadly, I have to join the crowd on this one. I was hoping that Kitchen 56 would make my memories of Vatra go away, but instead just reminded me all over again. Food was WAY overpriced and just OK. Kudos to Eddie the Server who brought with him the only charm available the second time we tried K56; I'd give him 4 stars if the review were based solely on his service & personality. I will say the interior is much better than the previous incarnation, but the spots (lights) at the counter-height 4 top shone in my eyes and made me feel like it was last call...and I don't drink.",2011-03-30
3929,189,2999,"Fabulous. 

Holy Kobe Beef Burger with Avocado, Bacon, and Cheese - It was the special of the day. I didnt care what it cost, I knew I had to have it. 

Come to think of it, that was the FIRST time in my life I've never ordered off the menu and actually went for the ""of the day"". I did it with my wine too!

I wasnt a HUGE fan of the parmesan fries, but I could be alone here. 

All in all, great place for some burger lovin! The milkshakes at the other table looked unreal!",2011-02-12
2645,1265,96,"I've been visiting, and thinking, and visiting again, and thinking, and finally, after a long deliberation, I am ready to issue a verdict. 

Ruling: It's OK and a worthy stop in Scottsdale for a pre-dinner beverage. 

Sure, I could front load my review with spicy adjectives, overinflated superlatives, some forced humor, and throw on an added star and hope for a ROTD (come on, don't pretend that you don't know the formula), but I am not selling my stars for a day on the big screen. 

If it's been said once, twice, and even thrice, need I repeat it? Yes, because it is true -- this is not Postino, and for that matter, this is not Kaz. It is a good, local spot to grab a glass of wine, maybe even with your mom, who may not be hip enough to chill at Postino on Central (which really requires little hipness, I mean they let me in), or your dad, who may not be able to read in the dark at Kaz, or maybe for that friend from Gilbert, who you know, wants to walk the wide straight path of predictability. 

Predictability isn't bad...in this case, that means a good wine selection (could rotate more), full bar, usually one good draft or two out of 5, decent cocktails, and decent food. The food is not really what you come for. The bruschetta is sub par, but the salads are above par. And, I have to add, hummus with no flat bread or pita?? No. No pita for you! 

Service runs from friendly (read, management) to disillusioned and inattentive. The latter tends to happen if you sit outside. The last time I was in, I think grapes were crushed, olives were pressed, and chickpeas were ground...at least they could have been. 

Often they have live music too, which runs from the somewhat awkward jazz guy who keeps talking to you to the Motown wedding singer -- which on at least one occasion brought out near Elaine Benes-style dancing -- now that was worth the visit and waiting for the grape crushing.",2011-02-11
4659,2629,171,"Long ago, Salvation Army used to be the place to go when you thought of ""thrift stores"". Sadly, this place is WAY overpriced for being a thrift store. I have chatted with other random people who thought the same thing about this one - way too expensive!  :(

I don't know who is pricing this stuff, but they are out of their mind, probably watching too much ""Storage/Auction Wars"" or ""Pawn Stars"" thinking that everything is worth a ton of money.

Goodwill is just up the street on Grand and has better prices.",2012-04-27
163,153,155,"Meh....decent Filibertos knockoff but the place feels like a major health hazard considering how new it is.

Just think Filibertos with less quality control and smaller portions.",2010-11-22
5040,470,408,"Ok, I'm new to the whole Thai food thing, and I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy food, so take this review for what it is....

I was told by plenty of uber-Thai food fans that this place was the bee's knees, but I wasn't too impressed. i kept it pretty standard ordering just pad thai noodles with tofu and iced tea. the iced tea was killer (i find that at most thai places, what is it with the iced thai tea phenomenon??)

the flavor was pretty bland, i have to say. it was the right amount of spicy, but just still bland, no bueno. plus, for a thai place, they did not cook the tofu well, it was totally bland, too.

i was disappointed, but i will probably go one more time because you never know if you just catch a restaurant on an off day. it was super busy on a tuesday lunch hour, too, but we got in and out pretty quickly, so it's good for a work lunch.

***update 1/08
I'm glad I made that disclaimer in my original review, because I've been back three times (only for p/u) and it's now one of my top thai places. Maybe I was bitter because my editor took me there for my year review to tell me the paper couldn't afford more than 3 percent raise (on a reporter's salary, that's about 35 cents - you can imagine my bitterness). Hahahaha. I'm still not 100 percent a fan of their tofu, but the other entrees I've tried are not as bland as my OG visit.

It's a great spot to pick up even if I just walk in and order because, what I assume is the owner (a middle-aged Asian women who dresses professional), is SOOO nice and helpful* with the menu and there is a small bar (really small, like 4-5 seats) where I can order a draft and hang out for the 10-15 minutes it takes to make my order.

*definition of ""soooo nice and helpful"": She answered all our questions regarding level of spiciness and confusion over which entrees included noodles or rice patiently and with a smile; suggested one of the most delicious fried banana/ice cream desserts I've ever had; and, one time she realized we weren't finished with our beers when our tightly packaged food was place on the bar, so she spent five minutes undoing the tie to poke holes in the to-go boxes so the steam could escape and not make our food ""sweaty"". RIGHT ON!

that definitely earned them an extra star for service! so... more like 3 and half


***************************
i'm bumping up another half star because their stellar customer service is dead-ion consistent every single time i come here. i highly recommend the Yupha's House fried rice with tofu - flavorful and not too greasy. and big points for being able to order every single item on the menu as spicy as you want it.",2007-02-20
6876,693,286,"I am one of those people that talk crap about Gordon Biersch behind its back but I'm nice to its face. I go there and continue having expensive yet mediocre meals, but like I just said- I go there. My boyfriend asked me once ""why do it to yourself when you don't enjoy it? "" I don't know. Maybe I'm a masochistic eater. Actually, I'm just very agreeable and I work super closeby. AND if I didn't go there I would just walk over to Whole foods and spend a zillion dollars on a goulash-y takeout container that I don't even like after I pay for it. For me, lunch is more about getting out and doing something else for an hour a day. If someone wants to go to GB I will happily tag along and probably eat, even though I know I wont like it. At least there's not much harm in that, except to my wallett! PS- Lori is the nicest, sweetest server/bartender ever and chatting with her makes up for the crappy food!",2009-12-04
2772,517,2239,"Eh, lukewarm feelings about this one.  I had lunch here and the service was exceedingly slow even though the restaurant was not at all busy.  The server looked at me like a martian when I asked a question about the salad.   It may have been an off-day...  The food was good.  Inventive salads... it didn't exceed my expectations, though.  Hip mid-century modern decor...  I'm not sure that I would go back on my own nickle.",2006-06-12

What is there to say that hasn't already been said other than hands down it is my go-to coffee spot in Arizona.  Such a warm and diverse group of people, rotating artwork, the perfect study music playing in the background (although it is played a bit loud), espresso roasted on-site and baked goods made on-site.

332,302,309,"After a year in the Valley, one of my girlfriends took me to Side Bar.  I really like the atmosphere.  It was sleek yet cozy. The night we went in, it was hopping but not overly crowded.  A welcome sight considering much of my first year in the Valley was spent in crowded, pretentious Scottsdale hotspots. 

As I get older, I crave more intimate setting and SideBar fits the bill.  Also, I give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause.  SideBar is just that kind of establishment.  If anyone is on Twitter, follow #buzzcation.  @SideBarphx has let #buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours.  It's a cool crew so come out and joing and I commend SideBar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples. :)",2010-02-14
3962,1566,3024,"This place, to me, is just like Aloha Eats in Chicago. The menu offers pretty much the same options as Aloha Eats and is also about the same price. My brother recommended this place because my mom was craving some Hawaiian BBQ, and L &L hit the spot. L & L is located in a row of fast food places - think mall food court within a shopping center. What -- you can't decide what to eat and are in the area? Uh, no problem. 

My mom and I shared the BBQ mix plate. I wasn't too crazy about the chicken, the beef was pretty tender and tasty. I was a little disappointed to see that the mix plate only offers one slice (?) of the short rib, which my mom loved. My dad enjoyed his Atkins version of the BBQ beef, but he loved the mahi mahi mini plate he had on our second visit to L & L. Yeah, I said second visit .... second visit in 4 days. It's pretty much on our ""to-eat"" places the next time we are Phoenix.",2008-07-16
9449,2967,801,"I usually throw away those value pack coupon envelopes you get in the mail, but decided to look at them this time & see if I'd use any. I pulled out ones for the dry cleaners, zoo, a burger/hot dog joint & Red Devil. 

Most of them were for dine in only but a couple were for delivery as well, so I used the one that was for a 16"" cheese (toppings were an additional $1.25 each) & 20 wings for $21.95. I had looked at their website before ordering & the combo (pepperoni, sausage, onions, mushrooms & green peppers-but we skipped the onions) sounded delish so we got that with the NY mild wings. They don't have their desserts listed on their website so I asked the guy who placed our order & decided on the cannolis (1 for me, 1 for hubs). He said it would be a lil over an hour & to my surprise it arrived in 45 minutes.

The pizza was good, not Mamma Mia's good, but good! The wings were bomb; crispy, the right amount of sauce & they smelled amazing! The cannolis were pretty good but we didn't really prefer their ""style"". Instead of chocolate chips inside with the filling, the entire cannoli was dipped in chocolate. 

Total with coupon, $3 delivery fee & tip was $47. Not bad at all considering we will each be getting 2 or more meals out of it. We're fans & would definitely order from them again...maybe even dine in eventually!",2011-04-08
152,142,144,"Went there for a second time on Sunday.  The first time I came, I was underwhelmed.  I think the problem was that I went with only one other and this time I came with 5 others.  It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and over pitchers of Sangria ($20.00 specials on Sunday) and copious amounts of food I rediscovered the restorative quality of good food and great friends.  Had serrano ham and manchego with quince paste, pollo colonial (my favorite), lamb with mustard and mint, pan con tomate, quail with lentils and chicken drumettes.  With the exception of the drumettes (which tasted like overly fancy buffalo wings), the rest of the food was exceptional.  Small portions, yes.  A smidge pricey yet, but the communal feeling of being with your good friends in the open air sharing vino and small plates is priceless.",2011-03-28
3560,2186,825,"The ever evolving menu changes again, But a coupon made it a decent buy.

I will admit my co workers 2 for 1 coupon is why we went in. This means ~3.25 per burrito vs the usual $6 range.

What I didn't like was that my vegetarian burrito did not have vegetables in it, it was just a bean and rice burrito with guacamole. I don't know how one gets the grilled veggies in their burrito but it is not by ordering a vegetarian burrito.

The drink and napkin station here has always been a bottleneck, getting a refill or more napkins is nearly impossible.

I do like the fact there there is Choula sauce in addition to the red and green tobascos. And I also like that the chairs are not nearly as bad as those at chipotle.

The best tip this time is get in before 12, otherwise be prepared for a long long line.",2010-09-22
2571,482,2095,"Live music, plenty of beer on tap, and a very happening place.  This place was packed with people however with a group of 6 we still found tables and chairs.  

I enjoyed some beers on tap, but wanted to try some food so we ordered the Copper Blues Burger.  Very good burger, fresh tasting and the bacon and cheddar hit the spot.  The fries are good, which I normally do not eat at all.  

Nothing like enjoying a nite out with friends.  Live music, great food, and plenty of drinks and beers on tap to enjoy.  We all had a great time out.  Service was great and everyone seemed pretty friendly there.  Great atmosphere here.",2012-12-28
3407,2126,2663,"I had not planned on being a Mac owner.  My family - oh so very sick of me constantly complaining of Vista -  on first an HP, then a Dell, packed me off to the Apple store a month ago and well, now I have a MacBook.  The sales associate helping me pick out the perfect Mac was good enough, even with two perfectly good (except for the Vista) PCs at home, to convince me I needed this computer.

Do I love it? Not yet.  I like it, like it a lot.  I'm especially loving not having Vista issues that I had been having.  

I'm enjoying taking the one on one classes  to teach me how to use my Mac.  Each time I take a class - I've had 4 now, I have a different teacher and each one bringing a different spin to my classes.  They are nice, friendly, patient, highly knowledgeable.  They are teaching me so many cool features and applications that I can do on my Mac.  My fave so far is the translator.  I do some business in Mexico - my Spanish is limited - so in just one short month the translator has just been a god send.

The store here at the Biltmore is consistently packed with people, visiting the genius bar, taking group classes or the one on one class and making expensive purchases. I am amazed in this economy just how very busy the store is.  

I'm not totally convinced a Mac is the only way to go (almost though) but this store has some of the best customer service I've ever experienced.",2009-02-18

9363,234,2424,"I like Over Easy. The former location had more charm but this one is bigger and you don't have to wait as much :)
The food is great and the owners are wonderful and friendly. 
We just ate breakfast there. I got the 3 eggs over easy with mushrooms. The eggs were way too raw. I told the server about it and I asked to just get 2 eggs over easy instead of remaking the dish as the kid in the table was getting grumpy. That's what I ate for breakfast. The server didn't take it off the bill. I wouldn't say anything about it but I didn't get to eat the dish I wanted but still got to pay for it. Not cool.
The Ppllo Loco is great ! 
Hopefully this is a one time issue and the owners are still on top of everything like they used to be.",2011-11-15
5625,79,4049,"I've always wanted to go to Rokerij and when my date suggested it last night - I was all for it!  I was NOT disappointed.  

We spent our evening downstairs in what I can only describe as ""speak-easy"" atmosphere reminiscent of my days spent in the DC area.  I loved it.  Decor was spot on with stone walls, a fire place with comfy leather chairs strategically placed in front.  A big bar took up most of the room with some comfy look booths placed around the outskirts of the room. Lots of great details in decorations and design.  Our bartender was friendly and efficient. His suggestions on wine (1/2 price bottle!) and the manhattan we had were spot on.  He checked in with us and was attentive, but not overly so, letting us enjoy each other's company.  

We tried 3 of the small plates:  the roasted pepper bruschetta, tenderloin skewers and the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Honestly, I was expecting to be hungry afterwards and was ready to order something else in addition to that, but we held off until we received our food and I'm glad we did. The portions were pretty large and food rich.  Everything tasted great...the bacon and tenderloin were served on long plates that had 3 different sauces...a creamy queso (I think), a spicy red sauce and a green tomatillo-like sauce.  The red and green were really good - the white was a bit bland....but I'm also not a fan of cream sauces, so don't take my word for it.  The bruschetta was more of an italian style bruschetta (bread, peppers layered on top with melted cheese).  Tasted good, but my only complaint would be that it got a little mushy because there was so much topping on it. My date enjoyed it.

Overall, a great experience. I can't wait to go back - especially when looking for a laid back, cool atmosphere. And I definitely want to try more of the food!",2012-05-30
9937,4164,816,"What can I say... I am a bargain shopper! I'm not cheap, but I get more satisfaction out of getting a bargain than I do spending a ton of money for a name brand item at Nordstrom or Sax Fifth. That being said, sure you can find a pair of shoes you'll like here, but the selection is simply OK, and its usually full retail price. Most of the time they have a two-for-one deal or get the second pair half price. Still, its never really any kind of sweet deal.",2009-09-22

1488,19,1282,"Visited recently for the first time.  Enjoyed happy hour appetizers on the patio.  Cool place for outdoor dining, the waterfall added a nice background.  They offer smoking and non-smoking on separate sides of the patio.  Of course you know that if anyone is smoking, the entire area gets to ""enjoy"" the smoke.  Being a non-smoker, I would appreciate an true non-smoking area but being outdoors was too compelling to pass on this beautiful day.  Another small observation - the tables were too low for the chairs causing you to lean over to eat and the chairs were not comfortable at all.  

We ordered chicken quesadilla & crab cake appetizer.  The quesadilla was made w/ green chiles and cheese, served w/ green & red salsa.  Didn't care for the red salsa but the green was pretty good, rather mild.  A side of sour cream was all that was missing here.  Crab cakes were ok, nothing special.  Served w/ a nice side salad it made a very good small meal.  A side of some kind of orange sauce (chipotle?) for the crab cakes that seemed really HOT to me - skip this next time please.

Just based on the outdoor atmosphere alone, I would definitely come back again.",2012-03-16
2404,899,1977,"Been going to Pita since they were a take out only in Tempe. Fast forward 15 + years. They are getting too big for their britches. They started franchising, hired some corporate goons and that is where it started to fall off. 
The chicken has always been great but is faltering. There was never any better hummus on on the planet until they added all the red oil? Be very careful of seafood. I love the seafood dishes here, absolutely fantastic, but they have made me ill on more than one occasion. I was even hospitalized  once from the shell fish.
 I have some good friends that are still managers so I go back occasionally to see them. They are not as thrilled either. Too bad. All good things come to an end. This was the best unknown gem in Arizona for years.

I have a new crush... and it's Christopher's Restaurant's pizza!  

I've been holding onto a restaurant.com gift certificate I'd purchased to use at Crush Lounge for a long time now and decided it was time to use it.  I arrived w/ high expectations, of both the ambience and the food, and I wasn't disappointed... much.  The service was a bit spotty at times- we were immediately greeted when we entered and were seated quickly, but the wait that came after water delivery was a bit long at a time when there were no other guests seated around us.  (Perhaps there were other guests seated elsewhere, but they weren't seated at the lounge, at the food bar, nor outside... Indeed, it seemed like were were the only ones in the room, besides the cooks at the open kitchen area, the servers, and the bartenders.)  Bread was delivered, but we were each given only one one-inch slice of a baguette.  How strange, especially when the butter cup held enough butter to spread over a whole loaf!  Whatever...  Two of the three dinner specials were relayed to us, w/ the promise of coming back to tell me about the scallop dish, but when our server finally came back ten or so minutes later, he asked if we were ready to order, so I had to remind him about the scallop entree... What was in it, and how was it prepared, and how much?  Hmmm, maybe he was ready to go home...

Came in w/ Mom, so we had to try the calamari.  I also chose the Duck confit, goat cheese, and fig pizza.  For dessert, we had the profiteroles.  I really liked the calamari's coating-- lightly battered and fried golden-brown.  My fave pieces of the squid are also my Mom's fave, the tentacles, so these were soon finished.  At least half of the remaining pieces, the sliced bodies, were undercooked-- poor value for the $12 menu price tag (and I was charged $13 on the ticket).  The pizza* was TERRIFIC!  Loved the semolina thin crust, and the duck confit gave the entree a great smoky flavor-- I thought perhaps there were lardons included in this dish too, but all the smokiness came from the duck.  Mmmm.... The goat cheese was very creamy, and there were lovely chopped figs all over the place-- I'd order this pizza again in a heartbeat!  The profiteroles were fantastic, as well.  Three sliced choux pastry rounds, filled w/ dark chocolate sorbet, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, sat on a pretty display made of chocolate ganache and creme anglaise, whole blackberries and blueberries, and a sliced strawberry.  More ganache was poured over the top of one profiterole upon presentation.  I asked if I could have more ganache, and our server quickly obliged-- thank you!!  We loved the crisped flakiness of the pastry (so perfect!), and out of the three flavors, we liked the fudgy dark chocolate sorbet the most.  I tell you, if I could've licked the plate clean, I would have.  :)  Excellent dessert-- I totally recommend!

(*Pizza reheats well!  Still lovely in flavor and just as crispy as it was when it was first delivered.  Can't wait to go back and try the other varieties!  Happy hour UYE, anyone?)",2011-07-30
3058,1981,1060,"Fantabulous! That's the best way I can describe the food here.

I really wanted to get a photo of my dish, because it was a work of art, despite just being pasta et al piled onto a plate. Unfortunately, between my hunger and the amazing aroma wafting off the plate, the camera never made it out. This dish, by the way, was the strozzapreti. I could go on about how wonderful it was, but I'll spare the reader. Oh, there were also the Zucca chips. I nearly bit the waiter's hand off when he tried to remove the scraps.

In truth, I would love to give this place 5 stars. The food, without a doubt, warrants that rating. However, the place was pretentious to the point that it was palpable. The acoustics of the restaurant made for a very loud experience. Oh and the server was actually a bit too attentive. She was great, very nice, on top of everything... but just a little too much.

Overall I'd like to go again and try out some more of what they have to offer! (And of course, have more zucca chips...)",2011-09-01
4823,2702,3575,"I have been coming to this place for atleast 5 years. This is a favorite of my friend's whole family. 

This place is so very consistent. They always have the same good things. If you're looking for buffet variety this is not the place. 

Everyone is so very nice. This place has been open for 30 years for good reason. I have never ordered from their menu because their buffet is so good. 

Go and try not to get hooked.

5199,2819,3806,"Being a former band nerd in high school, so much nostalgia kicked in upon entering the museum. I saw all the instruments I was familiar with in high school, and many others that I wasn't familiar with (and learned much about). 

They supply you with headphones and a wireless receiver that plays the audio/video of the different sections you walk into. Each plays a sample of what the instruments sound like and some give detailed history on the instrument. Very enlightening experience.

Best Part IMO: They have a room where you get to test random instruments to your heart's content! I really wanted to go ham on the gong but there was a sign that said something along the lines of ""do not hit the gong repeatedly"". I was disappoint... but otherwise many other instruments in there kept me occupied for awhile (xylophone, conga, harp, etc)

It's not an arm and a leg to get inside, and this place has something for everybody. You're sure to spend a few hours enjoying yourself here.

If you're going to do anything in Phoenix, this is one of the spots you should definitely check out.",2011-08-25
5871,3030,4195,"We've been to the Hub twice now and I like it. I'm a little afraid to review it since two of the places I've reviewed in Ahwatukee have now gone out of business (RIP Villalpandos and Grill Wrap Cafe). But hopefully neither of those are my fault since I gave them good reviews. :) The first time we went there I had the New Yorker (Hot Pastrami, Hot Corned Beef, and Cole Slaw with Russian Dressing on Rye). It was pretty good! It was piled high with tasty meat; but not so high like at those New York delis you see on those Man vs. Food type shows that you know there is no way you could even eat them unless you are a snake and can unhinge your jaw, yeah, not like that. My boyfriend got the French Dip, which disappointingly was not able to be on the French roll because they were out, but he said it was good anyway. They seem to be having a bit of trouble figuring out their prep. They always seem to be out of something, both times we've been. Either a meat or one of the kinds of bread. I don't know if they need to simplify their menu or if it will just take some time to figure out how much of everything they'll go through in a day; but I hope they figure it out before it's too late. The second time we went I had The Godmother, it is REALLY good!! That hot pepper relish and the garlic sauce TOTALLY make it amazing. It's super tasty! The boy had the Meatball sub which was really good also. It was not really a classic marinara, a bit spicy, but the meatballs themselves had a lot of good flavor. It's pretty cheap there to make it a ""meal"" with the drink and chips and of course the cookie always comes with it, which are really traditional and tasty. The service is really polite and friendly. You can tell they are really putting their heart and soul into this place to make it work, and I really hope they can be successful. We'll be in to support them when we can.",2011-03-06
3767,1746,199,"We decided to try out Rudy's last night, hoping the lines wouldn't be too long since it was still 107F outside.  We lucked out!  There were only about ten people in front of us, so we felt we scored!  

I am a big fan of Texas BBQ, namely beef ribs and brisket.  I usually go for the lean brisket and light to no sauce (in true TX form).  

Last night we ordered the moist brisket ($12.98/lb), coleslaw and a turkey sandwich ($4.99) for DD.

With three fountain drinks, the price was about $21.  DH also went back and got the banana pudding and the chocolate pudding for DD and himself.  I think he spent about $6 on that.

THE FOOD:  The brisket was DELICIOUS.  It was perfectly smoked and not too fatty for my tastes.  It had a good amount of char on the outer edges, which is my favorite.  The meat stood alone on its own.  Very good sign!  I did try both the Sissy Sauce and the BBQ Sauce.  The BBQ sauce was quite good.  

The turkey was smoked, which is not my favorite, but it was pretty good.  DD ate it after making me remove the ""black edges"" off and getting her two slices of bread instead of the bun it came on.  That was fine with me because I put my brisket on the bun with some BBQ sauce and I was a happy camper.

The coleslaw was good.  It was sweet, but not too sweet.  It was crunchy and a little reminiscent of the KFC coleslaw, tbh.  

We were disappointed that they did not have any mac n cheese.  Mac n Cheese goes great with brisket!!!

DESSERTS: The chocolate pudding was yummy and had an oreo cookie crust at the bottom.  

The banana pudding was just okay.  A friend of mine gave me a recipe for banana pudding years ago that is really simple and appears to use the same ingredients, but is far superior.  I wonder if I should share it with Rudy's?!  

Overall, we will definitely get Rudy's again.  However, we will probably just order the brisket to go.  We can make the sides for a lot less and I am sure DD would prefer something other than the turkey for dinner.  

Yes, that's right, will be back.",2012-05-22

9585,1658,6215,"While I don't like to hype places up (because really, how GOOD can any one place be) ...How good can one burger joint be over another, or how good can pizza be over another pizza place (when weighing the ones that are all generally Good in the Public Opinion).  Now the word around town is that The Grind is Sofa_King Great.  I will say about The Grind that when you're up for a Burger, this place hits the spot.  I've been here once before August 2010 (don't remember what burger I had but recall it was good) and the other night I had the Peppercorn Burger and it was as good as it gets.  I was starving and really hadn't eaten all day and that helped add to how much this hit the spot, but make no mistake, it was really good and I do enjoy this place for the atmosphere, service, and quality of food.  My friends wife got one of those healthy wraps and she liked it a lot.  The sweet potato fries (we ordered the half sweet potato and half regular fries) and they were good.

As for some other areas to review: The atmosphere is nice.  It's casual and not too dark and not too light inside.  (That's how I like it).  There's multiple flat panel TV's above the bar, so plenty of games on at any given time (That's also how I like it).  The service is fine (although based on some other reviews people have been so so satisfied about the service.  That's often going to be the case with most casual establishments - so sometimes it's good, and sometimes not to our satisfaction).  Such is Life!  Anyway, back on track here, the Wait staff and Bar staff have been worth the 20% tip both times.  No complaints by me about this place, however I do see some 2 and 3 star ratings on here.  

Where I will dock 1 star and sort of agree with Kristi D.  She mentioned the large photo of Sheriff Joe Arpaio on the wall (while I sense that Kristi doesn't care for Sheriff Joe, I'm neutral about him), but I agree about all the oversized photos of notable names in town who have dined in The Grind.  I'd much rather see real artwork or real photographs on the wall - and not photos of Sheriff Joe, Mark Grace (for those who don't know, he's a former baseball player), and the Mayor of Paradise Valley, all holding their burgers.  Who the hell cares about any of them and their burgers.  I think I'd be more ok with having these photos above me, but they are HUGE enlargements and a bit overkill.  And they are for sale and the proceeds go to some cause.  Look, I'm all for causes and shit, but I wouldn't spend my money on a 36 inch enlargement of these local ""notables"" holding a burger.  The whole concept is pretty stupid.  But hey, I'm generally uptight and been doing photography 20+ years and probly am just hating on the fact that my photos are hanging on the wall.
 
Side Note:  For those who might have previously had ""Liked"" The Grind on Facebook but no longer have their page as a Like, it's because they apparently had their group page hacked, so they had to start over.  I found this out when I Liked it the other day noticed there were only about 165 Like's, and certainly I knew this place was way more popular than that.  When I commented that, they commented back about it being hacked and starting the page over.

   The first gold-strike was made in 1892, and it took just a little under a year before the town came to life. One rich strike after another supported the town and approximately 4000 people who lived in the district for five rich years.
   The town boasted 3 saloons, a boarding house, general store, blacksmith shop, brewery, meat market and a school house. Just when it looked like the town would outgrow Mesa, the vein faulted, the grade of ore dropped and the town died a slow painful death.

I have been here quite a few times; it is a place my girlfriends like to come to so when I want to hang with my girlfriends and get a mani/pedi this is where we meet.  Although today I was solo:(.  The ladies here do a really good job; my manicures always last a really long time and they are really nice and accommodating.  Today I had one girl doing my pedicure and another doing my manicure... now that is what I call service!  I was out of there in a hour.  They do not have a tip line on credit or debit so bring cash for the tip.  Today I did not have cash ( i forgot)  they were so nice they said next time I come I can tip then if I want.  I came back anyway to tip them because it was so fast and my nails look great.  Oh another thing I forgot to mention is they use the hot rocks for the massage part for both the manicure and the pedicure and the callous remover is part of the cost of the pedicure.  Total for both services including getting french manicure on toes and fingers was $42.00.,2008-06-20

4464,2555,552,"I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating.

They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line. 

Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.

Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.

I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR.",2011-04-18

6215,2332,3318,"I met some friends last night at Cadillac Ranch and this was my first time going. The space has a very odd layout, but there are two bars (one inside and one outside on the patio) and both have plenty of TVs to watch. There is also a very cliche mechanical bull, but unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) no one rode it while I was there.

Service at the bar was really good, but when our group moved to a table, service became spotty. We had two servers for our table of 11 and one would take a drink order or would be asked for something and then not deliver it or something would get missed...the two servers just didn't coordinate very well. Luckily we weren't in a hurry and were a pretty laid back group. I only ate the Cadillac salad (mixed greens, tomatoes, cheese and croutons) and it was a nice size for $7.95. However, and maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine, but I hate when restaurants put the dressing on for you! I prefer for it to come on the side, as it does in almost every single restaurant I have ever been to, so I can put on as much as I would like. I did try a few of my friend's fries and they were good...not oily and for fries, they were actually pretty light. As a note, for groups, they put an automatic 20% gratuity on the bill, not the standard 18% most other places do.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place as a lunch or dinner destination as I was not impressed by the menu or the entree prices which seemed on the high side for what they were. However the three stars I am giving Cadillac Ranch are for their happy hour:

$2 domestics
$3 imports
$3 Fat Tire bottles
$3 Flavored Smirnoff Vodka drinks
$3 Margaritas
$4 Rum (Captain Morgan)
$5 Vodka Martinis
$3.50 to $5ish select appetizers (there are about four or five)

I'm always happy when I can get Stella drafts for cheap. Also, according to the bartender, one of the margaritas they serve can only be purchased a maximum of 4 times by one person because it is so strong. One piece of advice: If you start at the bar and move to a table, close your tab at the bar even if they offer to transfer it to your table. We had a huge mess last night and some people overpaid and some of us underpaid.",2009-02-13

They do the pork here more like a pork patty, or meatloaf if you will. In Vietnamese cuisine, there are two different ways to do it, the other being grilled slices of pork. I don't know which I prefer as they are very very different.

You get a large amount of noodles, very fresh vegetables, and a generous portion of meat. The sauce is tasty, and everything seems very high quality.

We waited quite a few minutes (easily 10 to 15) for our order, which is a good sign for fresh preparations.  The joint is hooked up with a juke box, pool table, dining area with tables and chairs, and two benches near the register, for those waiting to take their food home.  There were special desserts in a glass display cabinet, including coconut clusters and sweets I've seen in Mexico.  The assortment of beverages is outstanding, offering both Coke and Pepsi products, juices, CapriSun, horchata, beer, and Sunny Delight!  The menu is about par for Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area, in terms of content and price.  I got a fish taco, which was outstanding!  No cheap tartar sauce here!  I also got a cheese quesadilla, which came garnished with lettuce and tomato slices.  The quesadilla was warm and fresh, on an obviously fresh tortilla filled with tasty cheese.

We arrived 15 minutes early for our 6:00 PM reservation Sunday evening, no problem because the place is dead, right? Not so fast! We get taken to the worst table in the farthest corner of the restaurant while passing by 80% of the tables that are empty. Luckily we noticed right away the table would be a good fit for 12 people not a party of two which we were. They graciously reseated us at a small table for two which was much better.

Now, after that you may think, why'd this guy give them four stars. Well they redeemed themselves a little later. My partner ordered an ice tea which they were temporarily out of. How does that happen by the way? Out of Ice Tea? But I digress, they wound up bringing him a complimentary Ice Tea once they had brewed a new batch.

I guess you probably want to know about the food. I started with the Beefsteak Tomato and Onion appetizer which was excellent, my partner loved his loved his French Onion Soup. We both had the Bone-In Kansas City Strip his was a little undercooked and mine was just perfect. We shared the Au Gratin Potatoes and Creamed Spinach...both were excellent.

2457,465,2014,"I want to preface this review by saying that I'm close friends with one of the sushi chef's in training, so we got a seat right at the sushi bar and really had a great opportunity to chat.  That being said, I will review this strictly on the quality of food, since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests.  (C'mon now, you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staff/chefs, so quit your whinin'!)

The quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi I've had in my existence.  The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef, and ask them what is fresh, and what they would suggest (omakase style).  

We had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin, yellow tail, o-toro (yes, the good stuff!), and a few other pieces.  Served with fresh wasabi root (not the hydrated green powdery stuff), this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses.

We had a few different rolls per the chef's suggestion, and all were spectacular (including some off the menu rolls).  The kim bap roll was highly recommended, and the quality was definitely memorable, better than most Korean-mom kim bop rolls I've had in my life.

We asked for ama-ebi (sweet shrimp), which was soft, tender, and sweet, with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.  This was the first time I've had such perfectly made ama-ebi, and it's made me want to continue my search in Chicago.

Some tasty mochi desserts, a few bottle of sake, and all in all, it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I.  

I'm sorry for those that have found a bad experience at Otaku, as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic, my advice to you is this:

1.  Don't ask for a table if you're party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter, because that's how sushi is meant to be served.  Getting to know your chef, the chef getting to know you, having drinks together, etc.  

2.  Ask the chef what he/she recommends.  Not all fish are equally fresh, and the chef will know what's best for the day.  And if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you liked/didn't like, they'll likely craft a sushi experience for you that you'll love.

Verdict:  If only Otaku were in Chicago... I might go broke.  Delicious sushi, and worth a visit!",2011-02-17

6520,1240,977,"I heart Rome's Pizza!! Being a native New Yorker, I have struggled over the past two years to find anything remotely close to NY style pizza. I had tried many local, independent places, but no one got it right. 


When I moved back to Scottsdale about 6 months ago my guy and I passed this place driving down McDowell road. I figured we could try it out (I'm always on the look out for some yummy pizza). Don't be taken back by the empty parking lot and shabby exterior, after all, isn't it what's inside that counts?? 


The food is always fresh. The Greek salad is great - it comes in small and large. The pizza is amazing (as long as you know what you're getting - NY style). I know that it's family owned, which I always have an appreciation for. 


The man that owns it does most of the deliveries. When I first moved to the area I called for delivery and he had to call me because he couldn't find my street. Embarrassingly, I only knew the street I lived on and not much more, so I couldn't help him. He told me that it was okay and eventually found the house. 
I expected him to get out of the car and give me a huge attitude, thinking I'm an idiot because I didn't know where I lived (could you really blame him?). But he was as sweet as could be and told me it was no problem. How refreshing! 

In a nutshell, hoooorray for Rome's!!",2008-10-29

The Naan plate was nothing special, but the blossoms were fantastic.  For dinner Hottie had the lab chops with couscous and I had the pasta with butternut squash and pesto.   The pasta was amazing, I watched the chef make my pesto to order... mmmm basil!  Hottie devoured every bite, so I would say he enjoyed his chops too.

My coworkers and I went to check out the food trucks that gather on Thursday outside of Whole Foods by Raintree and the 101. I saw that Mojo Bowl was there and made my mind up right away to get their food.

I decided to get the Red, White, and Kale salad. I love quinoa and kale so it was the obvious choice for me. I also wanted to try one of their smoothies out. I went with the Coco Coca. The description mentioned that it was like a drinkable Almond Joy and I was sold right there. The total came to $13, not too shabby considering the portions. I didn't even touch my salad because the smoothie was so fulling, definitely a meal in itself. Towards the end of the work day I was getting hungry and decided to try some of the salad. I was asked if I wanted a balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette to go with the salad. I told the guy whatever tastes better and he told me that would be the raspberry vinaigrette. The salad was delicious. The kale was chopped up so finely that it really didn't have a taste so if you're not a huge fan of kale you might still like the salad. The portion was huge, it was good for 2 meals. 

I try to eat healthy and like to support local businesses. Mojo Bowl definitely brings those two together for me. I can't wait to try more of their smoothies and food out soon!",2012-11-07

It was NOT crowded when we cruised in for the Sun Devil game this past weekend. We were greeted by a guest who asked if we had a reservation and then hollered to the waitress who said there may be a wait. At least they have a sense of humor!

The advantage for us was we got to take our pick of the TV we wanted to view the game. There were two Texas Hold 'Em poker tables going (not my thing so I don't know specifics) and I saw pool tables in a separate area -- photos on the website make it look like there's shuffleboard too.

She didn't even look at me, didn't bother asking why I was entering her place of business, didn't reply when I spoke and in no way acknowledged that I was even in her presence. Just handed me a ticket and was done with me. If this happened anywhere else, I would make an effort to never return, tell all my friends how horrible this experience was, and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business. Sadly, this was my Saturday morning at the DMV, a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell. With the same musac score playing...and the same voracious stench in the air..and the same spastic children running around (only in my version of Hell, it's politicians campaigning around me). 

So, I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early. Those nice people there not only told me there were only three DMVs open on Saturdays, they gave me a map. How precious. I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday (Seriously? Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley?) After receiving such a magnificent welcome, I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life. To simplify what was so bad, let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public: 

1) Bathe. The combination of water and soap, along with massaging the skin, creates an outcome that is most pleasing. Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot : http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/htf/755891987.html 

2) Sit still. Yes, I know we're all waiting here for about an hour. But tapping your foot, rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg aren't going to make time go any faster. Trust me, I was watching the clock. If you feel anxious, get up and walk around. 

3) Leash your children. If they cannot sit quietly, leave them in the car. It's winter, they'll be fine. It's not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers. It's even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me. 

4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls. To the lady behind me, I'm sorry you're not that experienced in stripping. The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl. Thanks to your continued conversation, I was able to figure out you were a woodworker. 

5) Acknowledge the humans around you. Yeah, I get it. I'm not that big. In fact, if I turn sideways I disappear. But, I'm still right in front of you so pay attention, quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg. Unless that was flirting, in which case you really need to find someone more your level. 

Oh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that, but I don't have the motivation to research it. 

Oh, and F724 was my number upon entering. I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper. Just so you know, that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-4 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship).

I went with a group of four on a Monday night.  (1/2 Price Bottles of Wine from 5pm - close on Mondays; needless to say, we took advantage of that special!)

We let my friend Anthony do the ordering since he'd been many times before and he also has a vested interest of sorts... We started with two salads: the prosciutto, zucchini, and artichoke (my favorite) and the goat cheese and pear... also quite tasty.  You can't go wrong with either one.  We then had the truffled harvest mushroom and the spiced pepperoni pizzas.  Yum!  The thin crust and the combination of fresh ingredients on both of them were perfect!  

Along the way, owner Julian Wright sat down with us to share some wine and conversation - he's fantastic!  While he was completely engaged in talking to our group, I could tell he was also constantly surveying the restaurant to make sure all was running smoothly.  Every patron that walked in the door received immediate attention including our group.  Our waitress was sweet and I liked that she gave some attitude back to Jared when he was joking around with her.

We had a blast on top of a great meal and ended up staying for hours enjoying  two bottles of wine (maybe more than that as I lost track) during that time.  One of them was a La Crema Pinot Noir, but I think we had a merlot as well and maybe another Italian Red.  I guess I'll have to go back and take notes next time.  Another reason to return will be to try the brusschetta - it sounds amazing.  

I have a feeling it won't take me as long to return to La Bocca as it took for me to get there in the first place.  You can't go wrong at La Bocca if you're looking for pizza, salad, wine, and all in a warm, welcoming atmosphere.  Check out their other daily pecials too - I know I will!",2008-11-28

I recently purchased four books for about $30 -- that's the price of one, new hardbound book -- and was thrilled by all the great bargains I found during my casual stroll through the many, many isles of books, cds and dvds.

What I love about the whole used bookstore concept is being able to give a new life to a book someone didn't want anymore.  I especially get a kick out of finding old books with inscriptions inside. One I found says:

       ""Pam, This is my number 1 all time favorite book. I hope you have
        a relaxing holiday with your family and look forward to adventures
        in the new year!""

I felt bad for the inscriber, since the book obviously did not become Pam's favorite, so I bought it in hopes that the inscription would ring true for me.

My friends and I settled into one of the sofa areas and made ourselves comfortable. They have a decent happy hour, all wines are 1/2 off and beer is $2.00 off. We ended up having some wine and a selection of brushetta, all was pretty yummy.  The brushetta wasn't the best I have ever had, but there was a nice selection and it was pretty tasty.  We had the brie and apples (delicious, how could you go wrong), mozzarella and tomatoe (also really yummy), brie and bacon which I didn't try and the tapenade (a little salty, but what can you expect from chopped up olives?).  Once happy hour ended, our very knowledgeable and helpful server told us that for $20 we could get a bottle of wine and another order of brushetta, so we did. Hey, why not, it's Monday!?! 

Ultimately, I was only supposed to stay for an hour (I was sick and jet-lagged and just needed to go home) and I ended up staying for almost four hours. As it got darker, the place took on a very sexy, relaxed vibe. I definitely like the place and I will be back.

Although in this case, I have to make an exception.  I'm really into the food at Buca.

I usually have a standard list of items that I order for the entire table when my family goes to Buca:

Bruschetta
Linguine Frutti DiMare
Margherita Pizza
Pepperoni Pizza

9225,2105,6033,"I had a craving for Mexican- American type food, and since there is no longer a Chi-chi's around my friend suggested we go here since I was visiting the area from out of town. She is a frequent diner here, and loves it.  I really enjoyed my experience as well. 
I love a great Chimichanga along with  re-fried beans and ordered a much  needed strawberry  Margareta.  So lovely!!!! I enjoyed everything on my plate!

 I Loved it so much I suggested we come back my last night in town for drinks and appetizers.
We decided to order the  Mini Chimi Sampler, Macayo's Famous Cheese Crisp that I ordered with ground beef (it almost looked like a cheese crisp pizza),Guacamole Dip with chips. They also offer free salsa and chips every time you arrive.
Like my friend- I would be a regular here. I know when I visit my friend that she and I will go back- at my suggestion and to  her delight!",2012-02-27

Fortunately for the Cen Pholks Lisa G has this aptitude that transcends through her decor and into her simplistic, but delicious organic food.

Now, here's my deal: you put prosciutto on your menu and and I'm gonna get b-boy on your hardwood floors like Ozone in Breakin' 2.  Lisa G's breakbeats the hell out of their prosciutto sandwich with caramelized onions, parm cheese, fig jam, and arugula on an Italian loaf.

We ordered drinks first along with a serving of Guacamole. Nice way to start off lunch! My wife ordered the Dilla Lunch while I ordered the Grande Burrito Lunch special. Both item arrived on a very hot plate-wonderful! Whenever we are dining at another Restaurant, a hot plate is always expected but all too often the hot plate fails to appear.

Store was clean and only stocked with desirable items and lacked the items that just arent used by the majority, but I am sure could be ordered if needed.    This planning I found easy to make my purchases in a quicker manner since I dont always have the time to sort through typical store junk, there just isnt any here! Only quality sought after items.  Management is second to none and the business is family owned and operated.   When you walk in your greeted and after a few visits by name even.  This is a huge plus and isnt found anywhere else in town that I have seen.   There is a prefered customer program and most livestock is local grown and special items are taken in a wish list and you can get called once available.    After my month long search for the perfect store to set up my custom order that could also fulfill my stocking needs I couldnt get my order in fast enough for a complete custom setup installed and delivered.   Pricing was fantastic and cheaper than anywhere in town and the ability to come in anytime and get advice no matter what the need is makes this shop feel like home when you walk in.   If your looking for a one stop shop that is friendly, knowledgeable, and isnt out to empty your wallet in a bad way this is your place.

BTW there was no offer made either to fix anything...  in times like these SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE AND QUALITY / CONSISTENCY will get you through.   if you don't know what a good meal is and you want to think you're cool cause you hang out in a place that looks like it was furnished by IKEA, you should try it.

Anyway, this place rocks. We aren't super close, but we pass up several coffee shops en route to Lola because the quality is top drawer.

The beans, fair trade, and the roast is perfect. The price of a bag of beans is amazing. Doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast. This is what is all about!

I have yet to find a better americano. A splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines.

330,300,307,"Whew!  What a hike.  Coming from Colorado, though, the relative comparison makes it just a 3.  

Firstly, it's definitely treacherous.  When we arrived between 730 and 8 on a Saturday morning, there were about four, maybe five firetrucks in the parking area...these rescue/aid teams just camp out there, I think, because of all the doofuses who don't plan accordingly waterwise or overestimate their ability to make this climb.  Also, two different areas of the Echo Canyon trail are especially steep and potentially slick, so they've installed some metal railings to help you along there...but only if you've got some gloves or if the temperature is moderate (uhhhh,...that doesn't really happen in Phoenix during the day in summer), because those damn things get hot enough to fry an egg.  Also - water, water, water.  Bring a LOT, or top off at the start of the trail before you go up (though the water out of that tap attached to the water fountain is about 85 degrees, yuk). 

It was a fun jaunt.  The view was worth it - not entirely picturesque as far as nature goes, but it was nice view of the city and surrounding area.  If you go, just be wary of the sun/heat, and know that you'll be clambering over and around boulders and such.  (If you trip, it's CURTAINS!)",2011-08-15
3010,1954,2404,"I love the Ranch Market!  The atmosphere is great, the produce prices are very reasonable, and the civiche is excellent! I never go down the center isles, as they appear to be filled with typical grocery store packaged foods  What makes Ranch Market special are the fantastic offerings all around the center isles.  

Here is my advice:  First, make your way to the fresca bar to get a fresh fruit drink, it's just past the bakery at the front door.  After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.  Yummy!  After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche, stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and don't forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert.",2010-02-12

2132,405,1779,"Unlike other reviewers, I didn't like the buffet, though my friends from work think it's a good value. However, I've been going for dinner to Flavors of India for nearly three years now, and have ALWAYS liked the food. FOI is my first choice for Indian cuisine in Phoenix, out of the four other Indian restaurants in the valley I've tried. 

Yes, FOI is in a strip mall, but once inside, the ambiance is pleasant. It seems quite clean, I never got sick from anything I ate there (that's saying a lot, as I admit to being a fussy eater), and the waitstaff is helpful. Bollywood videos on the large flat-screen wall display in the corner are an unusual feature, but the volume is low or completely muted, so you can watch or choose not to, it isn't distracting.   (Here's a footnote about that: I ate at FOI on the night of the presidential primary election. My dining companion noticed that most of the waitstaff was gathered around the TV in the bar, watching electoral results, so he asked our waiter if we could watch too. After getting the enthusiastic okay from the two other occupied tables, it was quite late in the evening, silent Bollywood was replaced by live news coverage with volume turned on).

Regarding the food: I love their mattar paneer (cooked peas in a tasty curried gravy, with small cubes of homemade mild-tasting cheese).  My super-spicy friend gets the lamb vindaloo (super-spiced as he requests).  Tandoori shrimp, chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier, the samosa appetizer (lightly battered and deep-fried cut vegetables) is fresh, warm and crunchy. Regular and garlic nan bread are everything they should be, biryani rice is overpriced (I'd stick with basmati rice as a side dish), and sweet lassi (a well-chilled dairy drink, similar in taste and consistency to a vanilla yogurt smoothy) is a nice treat. My spicy friend says his gin-and-tonic was weak, and they don't have ingredients to make a Bloody Mary, but hey, FOI is an Indian restaurant, so I can't fault them too much for that! 

Other pluses: open a bit later than many Phoenix restaurants (seating ends at 9:30 pm); very fast with takeout orders; there's lots of parking; the 16 North bus stop is nearby; silverware, glasses, white cotton tablecloths and napkins are always spotlessly clean.",2010-01-07

Nice and clean, easy to shop, wide aisles, no clutter in the end caps.  SO easy to shop this store.

Went in today for an advertised price on chicken that we were planning on having tonight.  Asked the meat guy if there was any more chicken left.  Was told that they were sold out.  I told him that the reason we came to his store was because of the price and we were planning on eating the chicken tonight with dinner guests.

5548,2929,248,"While staying at The Pointe Hilton Tapatio, we decided to eat here for our anniversary dinner. To sum it up, I've had everything better somewhere else. Nothing blew my socks off. 

Hubby is eating mostly vegetarian right now (due to a health concern), and he did really like his ""wild mushroom"" rigatoni. We weren't sure what was so ""wild"" about criminis and portobellos, but the pasta was in a light sauce with plenty of other veggies. His French Onion Soup was better at Capital Grille, my antipasto plate was far better at Craftsteak, and my ribeye was far better at 1130. They did serve a neat wedge of au gratin potatoes- multiple paper thin cheesy slices cut into a triangle. The gins are standard, but Hubby had a nice Bonny Doon Riesling. The free anniversary creme brulee was on the runny side, the vanilla was indiscernible, and the sugar crust was too thick- Ruth's Chris still wins that one in my book. Did I feel dinner was worth $120? Not so much.

The service at dinner was great, and it was fine at breakfast. Again, everything was decidedly mediocre and way overpriced. I've had a better Belgian waffle at IHOP, my bacon was limp, and the coffee not what I would expect from the Hilton. Hubby's BLT breakfast bagel was better.

3000,1950,2396,"I can't even believe I actually went to this restaurant.  My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience, it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste.  Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so....  Let me be clear that I'm not a food snob at all.  Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very, very much.  That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama. 

The decor was comfortable and breezy.  Everything else  - not so much.  1st it's nice that they bring you bread and butter, but a sweetly flavored butter?  Why mess with the pure goodness of butter?  The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet, and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth.  It was undrinkable until I cut it with water.  The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce.  So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp.  I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty, and in my opinion, contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat.  

As it was my friend's birthday, they brought him a complimentary dessert.  Very nice. He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust, chocolate mousse topping, sprinkled with crushed Heath bar.  Sounds good, right?  Vile, absolutely vile.  Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter.  On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though.    

My final issue was with our young, highly attentive server.  He was very sweet and well-intentioned.  However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective.  Don't say ""are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?"" or ""are we ready for dessert?""  Unless I've badly misinterpreted our relationship, ""we"" aren't doing anything together. Just a pet peeve -  I still tipped him 22% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk.  

oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy, quesadilla, cup of crab bisque, lemonade and glass of white wine?  $52.  for lunch.

Don't remember the specific themes the times we went to Scottsdale, but the ""Big Night Out"" meals go like this:  Cheese Fondue (you can choose the special or any from the regular menu) with assorted dippers, Salad Course (again, the special or off the menu), Main Course (if you get the ""Lobster Indulgence,"" it includes twin lobster tails, usually a couple kinds of beef (e.g., filet and sirloin), shrimp, chicken, salmon, and/or pork, often a stuffed pasta, and lost of vegetables) with assorted sauces, and the best part... Chocolate Fondue with fresh fruit, brownies, marshmallows, Rice Krispies Treats, etc.  Yummy!

I must say that your experience also really depends on your server.  If you get a bogus one, you might not have a great time.  We've had good experiences for the most part, some absolutely awesome experiences.

Also, check out each location's web site prior to making reservations.  They sometimes offer really great deals or promos, especially on weekdays.  This info might be helpful to those who feel like the regular price is over the top.",2009-03-27
7651,3578,435,"Are you one who likes the smell of a brand new car? How about the smell, or in this case, lack of smell, of a brand new gym? Now, for a limited time, a completely unsullied 24 Hour Fitness, at the MetroCenter, of all places.

At its current new state (it's been open for a week), this 24 Hour is in much better condition than the one on Camelback. No surprise there - everything inside here is brand spanking new.

The details:

* In contrast to other 24 Hours in the Valley, this one actually will remain open 24/7 (versus closing at night on the weekends). The guy at the front desk said this is due to how this location is zoned vs the other ones.

* The cardio area is equipped with 11 flatscreen TVs hanging from the ceiling, with one even tuned into soccer-centric GolTV (which means one less tuned to all those talking heads on brainless cable news stations - bonus). 

* The adjoining weight area is larger than the Camelback location and currently has all its dumbbells in place on the correct shelves, and all its weight machines are working. No new types of machines, though (this is a 24 Hour Fitness after all) but still all the standards, plus four flat benches and four incline benches.   

* Full basketball court (which could also be split into two half-sized courts). Camelback lacks this.

* Large stretch/ab area which also includes some contraption straight out of Tron/Blade Runner. I stood there and looked at all the diagrams, acknowledged that it must be useful, and walked away.

* Standard group X classroom, childcare

* A spotless pool area. If you've been to many 24 Hour Fitness, you'll know that this is a hugely appreciated factor. I anticipate it's not going to remain spotless for long, but doing laps in a crystal clear pool was awesome. No dankness here (yet). 

* Spotless lockerroom with wood-paneled lockers and branded Dial Ultimate Clean hair & body wash. I'm assuming the women's lockerroom has their own corporate soap sponsor (I find all this a little odd, but go figure).  But beyond soap, there's some contraption called SuitMate which is like a salad spinner for your swim trunks. Just throw your trunks inside it, press down, and in 30 seconds your trunks are water-free. How awesome is that?

* Is going here after work safe for your car, you ask? Well, when I left the gym two hours later at around 9:45 pm, my car was still there in the parking lot, untouched. Seems like the MetroCenter is full of surprises.

* All in all, a great gym that I'm sure will be a welcome addition to the area. However, it still rates 4 stars since:

A) Although all the equipment is brand new and the latest edition of everything, there is fitness equipment at other gym chains that this one is lacking. 

B) I'm anticipating what the gym will be like in 6 months. If it manages to stay as clean as it is now by that time, maybe a 5th star will be in order.",2007-09-23
9332,864,6088,"I've been to China Magic Noodle many times over the years; it's one of my husband's favorite places to eat. The employees are friendly and prompt to provide service.

I always get #34 (Beef, Noodles, w/XO sauce) or the #27 (Seafood Noodle Soup) and love both. The noodles plates are big; unless you are a big eater, expect to take some home. The mango smoothie w/boba is also delicious; you can taste the fruit and know it's fresh.

I agree w/some of the other reviewers regarding the smell - this place definitely has a ""smell"" to it, who knows what it is - but it's not a disgusting/offensive smell. Overall the place is clean, the service is good, and the food is great!",2012-06-29

Now, admittedly they have something of a soup-nazi routine set up and if you walk in and don't know the drill, it can be confusing.  So pay attention:   
1.  Look at menu.
2.  Decide what you want.
3.  Wait your turn to order.
4.  Order (give your name).
5.  Wait your turn to be called to pay the other girl for the order you placed.
6.  Pay her.
7.  Wait until your food is ready.
8.  Leave with your food.

Note that there is no place to sit inside - so you can either sit outside, or, (if it is 157 degrees out that day), see if you can find a place to sit over at LUX, they are very welcoming of Pane Bianco diners.

6653,1680,4649,"Let me be clear on one thing: I love this place. The DJ's they have make it a lot of fun and the movie selections are great. In addition, their beer and wine selections are quite tasty. 

So, why not 5 stars? I think that the crowd just has to pick up, really. I know they're currently working on adding new menu items and movie selections to the place, but right now, it can just be dead. I went in there most recently last Friday. There was literally only one other group of people there. And I use the term ""group of people"" loosely, considering it was a group of two. We ended up leaving, because I can spend time with just my group of friends at my house if I wanted to and we were looking more to have an outing. However, I wanted the FilmBar atmosphere and experience that I certainly get on Saturday nights and it just was not there on Friday. 

DO go on Saturday nights. DJentrification is great and the vibe is wonderful. BUT...more importantly...go on other days!!! This place needs to fill up. Go see a movie, the theater is great! Get some drinks for happy hour. Go on Friday night and Sunday night! It's a nice bar that really has more of a hip lounge kind of feel. 

And the great part is that they're improving every day. I think they're only about a year old and it sometimes takes time. But the staff is great, the drinks are perfectly chosen, and the music is generally pretty amazing.",2012-05-15

The prices were about average in comparison to other breakfast restaurants in the area and the menu had a wide selection of breakfast goodies. The food was extremely average...I would have to compare it to the quality and creativity of Denny's. Nothing special, and for $30.00 for breakfast for two...I would not go back.

I really enjoyed Chino Bandido's, but don't think I could go more than once during a trip to Phoenix (I'd get very large from eating like this!).  :D  Oh yeah, if you want something more than a snack, don't just get a quesadilla by itself.

6877,142,2396,"3 friends and I went for restaurant week.  Iruna has great ambiance and charm.  The service was top-notch, and our server made excellent wine recommendations.  The desserts were amazing.  The other food was just ok.  

Here's what we had:

tapas - tortilla espanola (which was complimentary) was delicious; chistorra (chorizo in cider w/ baby artichokes) was also good; pan con tomate was surprising because it didn't seem to be tapas.  rather it was huge chunks of grilled bread that didn't work well to distribute flavors and was oily.

entrees - trout with salsa navarra, eggplant, roasted peppers, onion and tomato was very nicely cooked and had a nice balance of flavors.  filet mignon with tomatoes and salbitxada was order medium rare but delivered very well done and over-salted.  It was refired, and v2 was the right temperature but still over-salted.

8611,1971,5714,"We went to ""THE PLACE"" for breakfast/lunch today. It must be a popular spot and was very busy. There were 2 specials of the day, Eggs Benedict and a French Toast stack. Both came with a choice of potatoes.
I went here based on the reviews from fellow Yelpers. 
My daughter ordered the burger, it came with fries AND salad for under 7.00. The burger was very well done, but it was 1/2 lb of ground beef. The fixings were on the side and it arrived on an unremarkable hamburger bun. The fries were crisp and the salad was fine but it was DRENCHED in a watered down thousand island dressing.
My eggs benedict was fine. Nothing to make me want to order it again, but not bad either. I would try their pancakes next time. They looked pretty good!
My husband's french toast stack arrived. 3 pieces of french toast with ham,egg and swiss cheese between the layers. Kinda like a Monte Cristo sandwich. They bring out warm maple and berry syrup. My husband liked it. But, said he would try something else next time.
I ordered my hashbrowns extra crispy, my husband ordered his ""burnt"", his order came out exactly how i wanted mine. Crispy dark golden and cooked well. Bummer I had to just eat the top of mine. We also wanted to try the biscuits and gravy. What a big let down. Quantity does not equal quality. The biscuits were large, and the gravy bland. Our service was ok. The people working there seem nice enough. They were giving out free THE PLACE frisbees.
They will be closing 7/21 and will re open 8/1 at the new location right up the street at 51st ave and Bell rd, in the old 3 Margaritas building.
Hopefully I will be able to update this one day and give a better rating.

Next time I will drive to Scottsdale to avoid the terrible service. Ended up waiting nearly 30 minutes just to get my new contacts. There was only one guy working the optical department and a massive amount of people and phone calls coming in. Obviously they need to staff better because you could tell he was getting flustered and was blatantly rude to a couple of the customers ahead of me. For my new (disposable) contacts it was $50. $50 for a two-week prescription! Are you freaking kidding me? Needless to say I went in with a headache and left with a migraine.

Oh and on top of that I thought getting a slice of delicious Costco pizza would help after such a crap experience but alas I was wrong. The lady at the food court (again there was only ONE person working) was rude and I felt I was in a drill line. She literally threw my receipt at me. Well, geeze thanks. Oh and the pizza definitely didn't taste like the Costco pizza I'm used to.

3687,1765,298,"I went to Eddie's House last night with the BF and two friends for restaurant week and it was a terrible experience. First of all, I had made a reservation for 7:30 more that a week in advanced and we waited until 7:50 to be seated. This was a bad omen, because, as it turns out, the whole night was made up of waiting. Our waiter (who did not share his name, unfortunately because I would tell anyone to avoid him at all costs) was terrible. TERRIBLE. He came by 4 times before taking our order when we were ready after 5 minutes. Each time was a weird excuse. First time he came by I asked for a restaurant week menu, he said 'a restroom menu?' Why would I say that, then I ordered a glass of moscato and he's like the XXXX (whatever brand it was) and i looked down and it was the ONLY moscato.... I was like ya... WTF? So I screamed what I wanted and he's like oh.... sorry.... I can't hear. Then he said 'Oh hey, I'll be back to explain things.' Explain what? we're clearly ready! 'Oh hey, are you ready to order? Well let me go take the order of that big table back there and I'll be back to take yours' (real quote) WHAT? Seriously? We waited over 40 minutes to order. What's worse, is that we looked over like where the ef is this guy, and he was chatting at the bar!!! What, were we not wearing the right clothes? Were we not hip enough to be served? Or was it that we were ordering off the restaurant week menu, are we not ordering enough to get service? Come on.

 So he finally took our order, and we each ordered all three courses at once, because who knew when he would decide to come back. We got drinks, everyone got beer, except me who ordered the moscato. This was good, but was served in basically a thimble, it was the smallest glass of wine I have ever seen. Then we waited... and waited... and waited. We ate the whole basket of bread (which was great, but overshadowed by our terrible service). We got our appetizers, we had at least one of each available (a peach soup, a salmon flat bread, and a fetoush salad). The soup was really weird, not bad, just different. The salad was overpoweringly oniony, but still tasted good, although it was supposed to have toasted pita and had one tiny piece... and supposedly the flat bread was good, but I don't like salmon, so I didn't try it. Then the waiter came by and said 'oh we're really busy tonight, that's why it's taking a long time for the food) Notice there was no apology or accommodation of any kind. He also asked if we wanted bread with dinner, we said yes, but no bread ever came... weird. 

We waited and waited and finally out food came. I ordered the chili chicken, the two boys ordered the meatloaf, and my other friend ordered the shrimp. I thought the chicken had a good flavor, but was really dry. The meatloaf was fantastic! It was really quite delicious, with onion strings, mushroom jus, and mashed potatoes... yum. Supposedly the shrimp were really spicy, but again, I didn't try it. We ate everything, so again, the food was good, the service was awful. 

So then the waiter comes by (about 10-15 min after we had finished) and says, oh do you still want dessert? um.... yes, we ordered it and it comes with our meal.... he says 'oh, cuz I think we just ran out of the pot de creme, but I'll look' Well two people had ordered the pot de creme TWO HOURS AGO!!!! Why weren't they left aside? 'Oh we had 200 more people show up tonight that expected' Well, We had a reservation, so it is not our fault that you cannot staff your restaurant appropriately or turn away customers when you are too busy to handle new diners. It does not make sense. What kind of greedy restaurant is this that they can't refuse a table when people who told them they came to eat there can't even get anything off the dessert menu. It turned out they had one left, then the other person who ordered it said, oh ok, i'll have the peach crisp then....'oh, well we're out of that too cuz like it's made fresh from peaches and we didn't buy enough for all of the extra people....' 

Maybe if we had been served in a TIMELY manner instead of over two and a half hours, they wouldn't have run out. Oh, and maybe if the jerk who was our server had put aside the desserts for us when we ordered it over TWO HOURS before the time when we actually got dessert, that would have been nice too. The desserts were good, the pot de creme was the best, the rest of us got a 'tiramisu' which tasted like cookie dough ice cream.... not exactly what I want in a tiramisu, but fine, I guess. 

Finally, we get the check (around 200$, so clearly we didn't spend enough money to warrant any service) and we right out how we want the bill split between the two couples, The waiter comes by, and the BF starts saying, oh we wrote down the amounts we want on each card. The snarky jerk waiter says 'Oh, you mean follow the directions, ok.' So much attitude! So rude. I wish we left no tip, cuz that's what was deserved. NEVER AGAIN.",2011-05-21

This is often called the largest mall in Arizona, and it shows. Each time I've done the usual ""mall walk"" I've easily lost a few hours trying to see it all. It's true that this isn't a place for anyone that doesn't care about fashion - but this is a mall that's true to its name. ""Fashion Center"" is no joke here. Lots of high-end designer stores, lots of mid-range affordable fashion stores, and a few random familiar stops like Hallmark and Pottery Barn-esque stores scattered through there. A decent food court, with a theater also conveniently down there. (But after spending so many hours at the mall, who has time for a movie?)

You can easily drop a few thousand here, so be forewarned if you're on a budget. Also, I almost wish I had a map in my pocket, because it can get confusing to remember which hallways you've already explored. And wear some comfortable walking shoes, because it's not easy to get in and get out of this one.

5048,611,3711,"What a great property. Only had been to the bar years ago after the renovation, finally had a chance to stay in a Studio room this weekend. I was over the moon after this stay.

I was looking for a nice weekend treat for me an my girlfriend. Vegas was tempting, but the drive eats up time I just don't have, and I don't gamble. For about the same as a discounted room at the Mirage and fuel expenses, I was able to get a gorgeous suite at the Valley Ho. 

Very fast, friendly check in. No lines, no bullshit resort fees and a personable guy behind the counter. Never get that in Vegas...

Decor is startlingly unique. In a sea of cookie cutter mega resorts, a nice spin on hip, 1960's American style is a welcome change of pace. The details are like no other hotel I've stayed in, and the grounds are well landscaped and immaculate. It's quite humbling to think this place has seen patrons for 55 years. 

Studio Suite is super cool. Clean, good sized and hip. Tub in the center of the room was very, very cool, and was very useful. Good bed, good linens, great shower. Dug the little patio and the large sliding glass doors were awesome on a cool fall morning. Good colors, too. Only a few gripes; the bed side lamps are unusable with their super bright, nasty color temperature CFLs. Thankfully, there's lots of other mood lighting available. Also, the ceiling was starting to look a bit worse for wear, with some sagging at the joints and some water stains. Flat roofs always leak, though. In room music system ala Hard Rock would be a great addition, since TV is for the birds.  

Location is unbeatable. A short walk to anything in Old Town, Fashion Square, nightclub block, etc. But far enough away from the bars that it's quiet at night. Found a great new restaurant (The House) on Main St. that I would have never stumbled across otherwise. Probably the only worthwhile, walkable district in Phoenix that never disappoints, and this hotel takes advantage of it. 

I will absolutely be back. Makes a great in town escape. Just wish I would have tried it out sooner!",2012-11-25

The cold smoked duck was sooo delish as was the special mountain leafy green with bean curd shreds (all minced fine and not on the regular menu). There was also a shredded pork dish with bamboo (excellent) and a pickled vegetable with fish soup. The soup wasn't really my thing because it was heavily seasoned with white pepper which I hate but the rest of my family said it was exceptional.

Our second visit was for lunch before heading off to the airport for the return trip. I could have eaten the entire scallion pancake myself as well as the cold spicy pork belly dish. Luckily, we ordered two orders of fried potstickers because those were delicious as well. We also had some tasty steamed pork buns but I was stuffed at that point.

They had a lot of local Japanese restaurants selling food, such as Nagasaki Grill, Paradise bbq, and Arai Pastry, which was nice but I am close enough to all those restaurants that I could just buy their selections any time at their restaurants.  I think I've been too spoiled by the Japanese festivals in San Francisco, since the food selection here was more limited and there wasn't as many booths to buy things from.  I did like the cultural shows, such as the taiko and the martial arts demonstrations, and the shaded area with the bonsai and akitas was nice.  I think in general though, if you don't live close to Japanese restaurants or haven't had a lot of immersion into Japanese culture, this is a good way to introduce yourself to it here in Arizona.",2012-02-26
7068,3403,1044,"As a vegetarian and sporadic health nut, I just love TJ's. They have a nice array of inexpensive fresh produce, including my beloved broccolini, for 40% of what Safeway charges.

I try to buy all my supplements here too, as they seem to be a lot less expensive. Yes, I'm all about saving cash on groceries and whatnot.

The downside? It's not one-stop-shopping; a trip always requires supplementation with another trip to a ""regular"" grocery store. This particular TJ's is teeny-tiny-small, and always chock-full of obnoxious and/or oblivious people who wield carts like weapons. My favorite is the woman who thinks it's an awesome time to teach little Jimmy how to push his own wee cart and comparison shop, and lets the little bastard cruise all over the store willy-nilly.

I had the roasted shrimp and grits. The grits were the best I have ever had (sorry North Carolina!). The shrimp portion was amazing. The dessert was great. I was surprised to see the offering of huckleberries. 

Sadly, the server forgot quite a bit of things. My client's wife ordered a second glass of wine to have for dinner, which was forgotten.

It was busy the last time we went, but we stood around inside the door for probably 10 minutes before an employee even noticed us.  There were other parties waiting, too.  You just had to stand around and wait for someone to bother seating you in one of the open booths.

Everyone was satisfied with their meal.  I've had the spinach tacos, which were very tasty, and I appreciate having a veggie option that wasn't a run-of-the-mill bean and cheese or chile relleno.

6147,521,4353,"I came to the restaurant specifically because of a recommendation. I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide.

However, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)

So I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.

When my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above. However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.

The waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's.

As a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off.

A fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered. Except the pasta was undercooked. I don't mean really firm al-dente. I mean some were still way under done. Now, I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook, and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me. But that bowl was almost inedible.

The waiter did offer to get me a third bowl. I declined and soldiered through it. We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal. The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems. Though I did agree to this, and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered, it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.  I do not intend to go back.",2012-01-01

The servers will patiently answer all your questions and appear as though they really enjoy seeing you pleased with your experience.

Since we have been here several times here is a list of some items we have had:

For one, if you don't mind spending the money the toro ""tour"" is great.  They have something like 5 different kinds of toro.  From real fatty to a little less.  Melts in your mouth.  The presentation is very impressive.  It is served on ice with different kinds of salt and (to us) a very unique way of presenting the wasabi.

All there other sushis are served perfectly prepared

The steak is excellent.  The flavor is spectacular,  grilled in view over an open flame and quite literally cooked, always and without fail, exactly to you specification.

All tempura dishes are great

Grilled zucchini.... Very good and juicy.

Seabass with miso.  Cooked perfectly.

I suggest you order to share and sit at the counter.  It makes for a very good experience.  This is the place where you should go in without worrying about cost.  Just go for it, tske your time and experience it all.  It will make for a very good experience.

Try their very unique drinks, they are very refreshing.

I had been dating a gal name Starbucks for the past few years. She was a plain gal, generic if you will.  She was dependable and available. I was feeling as if i needed more out of my relationship, as you can imagine. 
So, at times, I would cheat on my gal with another gal named Coffee Bean. Coffee Bean was Kosher and a bit edgier, yet had a leaner list of qualities. 

I needed more out of my relationships. They say that when you're not looking for someone new, they appear. Well, that was the case with my new crush named Press. 

I had been to High Street for dinner Kona Grill, yet most of the other shops and restaurants were closed or not yet open for business at the time. 

I ventured back during daytime hours to give them another opportunity.  I had heard about Press, so I was more than excited to give it a go. At this point I was still making caffeine a part of my diet, so i ordered something called a ""Dirty Chai."" This was a Chai with espresso shots. Press uses a powdered Chai which, in my opinion, works better than the liquid or tea bag forms. I was also given the option to have my frothy delight in a ceramic cup.  I opted for that.  I felt like i was having the type of coffee house experience I had only just imagined. 

Press occupies a well appointed space, too.  From the wood and granite, to the stained concrete floors, I felt as if i were in a European city, not a Phoenix strip mall. The free wi-fi is a major plus, in my opinion. 
Press goes as far as to have a ""dog friendly"" cart outside, in its ample outdoor seating area. 

I spoke with Steve, the owner of Press, at length.  In talking, I asked how Press came to be, and he said that his wife had wanted to open a coffee shop one day.  Well Steve, you have certainly exceeded her expectations, as well as the residents of the Greater Phoenix area.

The ambiance was great.  The place has a nice warm feeling to it and since it was cold outside it was really nice.  They had a large fireplace inside and after dinner we stayed for the great crowd that showed up and went outside.  It was pretty chilly but I didn't even notice as the fire pit was big enough to warm everyone around it.  They also had ample heat lamps.  

The food was fantastic.  I had the tomato soup with the grilled cheese crouton in it and it warmed me up and prepped me for my main meal.  I had the burger and tender belly bacon.  This was an amazing treat for my taste buds.  The bacon was not like any bacon I have had on a burger.  It was a perfect complement for each other.  I wanted another one when I was done but couldn't possibly eat anymore. 

The drinks were great.  They have an amazing wine selection.  The wines we were drinking were affordable and it looks like they really spent some time picking the right wines to carry.  They have some really nice wines that rival the selection of some of the really nice wine bars in Scottsdale as well.  My friends said that the mixed drinks were really well made and they were very happy with how they turned out.  They have just about everything you could want for mixed drinks.

Service was amazing as well.  They were really attentive and the owner stopped by to talk to our table.

The lunch was just as good as the dinner.  I had a shrimp BLT that rivals anything in AZ.  I was glad to see that had a variety of Dr. Pepper/Mr. Pibb on tap.  It was really relaxing to sit there at lunch and enjoy the crowd.  The service was excellent.

I was impressed, but not blown away.  Everything I tasted was quite competent, but if I had to choose a word to describe the menu, I would suggest ""staid.""  Perhaps even ""stodgy,"" but that may be more harsh than I intend.

Review the dinner menu.  http://bit.ly/aWqVVJ.  There, see what I mean?  Replete with Traditional American entrees and sides, at what I would consider fairly exorbitant prices.  I would say that I wouldn't go back to eat this food at these prices, unless someone else was paying.  

I should note that a big part of why I wasn't impressed is because this place is simply not my style.  The wait staff, attired in khakis and blue shirts, was a little too informal for the prices we were paying, I felt.  The menu options were a little boring for my taste.  The cocktail menu is exactly not what I'm looking for these days, although I will be very interested to see what Happy Hour looks like.  The decor is a tad heavy on the Old Southwest theme, although to be fair, this place not only pulls it off rather stylishly but also is among the most authentically old and southwestern establishments in the Phoenix metro area.  

The patio and open bar are fantastic.  The bar area is considerable, and the patio is palatial - up above Lincoln Dr enough to be fairly quiet, with a gorgeous view of Camelback, sunset here must be incredible.  

Anyway, back to the food.  Everything was very well executed, from the sticky buns we were served upon being seated to the desserts we ordered.  I chose the soup of the day to start, a tomato/basil concoction that was quite hearty and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The salads my dining companions ate looked boring to me, but they all claimed them to be excellent, with ""the best Caesar dressing ever"" and ""polenta croutons?!?"" being the verdict for the Caesar salad, at least.  On to the entrees.  I ordered the crispy duck, which I found to be delicious and quite hearty, though not what I would call crispy by any means.  It was a very sizable portion, and very well prepared.  My dining companions ordered the pork chop, the lamb, and the salmon, and we each sampled from each other's plates.  I would try the lamb if I went back, but the consensus seemed to be that everything was very well prepared, with the duck being a winner.  It was served with a heap of mushy sweet potatoes (just like my mom makes at Thanksgiving - delicious!) and red cabbage, which I sampled and declined to finish.  Again, not quite my style.  

We moved on to dessert - sticky bread pudding with a bourbon glaze and the warm chocolate cake.  The bread pudding was a winner at the first two or three bites, but grew one-dimensional as I continued nibbling at it.  The chocolate cake was decadent, among the best I've ever tasted.  It was clearly made with a considerable amount of dark chocolate, which seals the deal for me.  And in case you were wondering, my dining companions apparently have no stamina when it comes to dessert.  Suckers.  

Anyway, as I've said now several times, this place is just not quite me.  It's totally classy and very high in quality, but not quite adventurous enough for my taste.  I'd love to come back for brunch, and once they unveil their happy hour menu, I'm sure I'll be back to check it out, but I won't be back for dinner unless I can convince someone else to pick up the check at the end of the evening.  

As a side note, this place is so very Paradise Valley.  It's a welcome relief knowing that there is a place that is so anti-scene out there.  It's been a little while since I've been both the youngest and among the poorest in a room, and I will say it was a little comforting.  Just don't tell the Scottsdale people about this place, and we'll all be happy.",2010-02-11
313,285,294,"Went there for Dinner on a Friday night and I have to say I'm impressed by the quality of the food and the reasonable prices.  There's a great deal of variety and some creative New Mexican dishes.  I'd go so far as to say this is the best New Mexican restaurant in the East Valley!

5826,1617,4164,"Haus Murphy's was my first German food experience ever. The cuisine was OK but it isn't something I'd shove people down to get to. 

I went with a friend who lived in Germany for a bit and he said that Murphy's wasn't quite up to par. 

We ordered the sausage sampler as an appetizer. The sausages were tasty, but they were a bit cold. For something that is labeled a ""sampler"", I felt disappointed with only two types of sausages served in it. I don't know for sure what types they were, but they didn't taste unique to me, as it seems like you can purchase them in the meat section of any supermarket. 

The sausages were served with three types of condiments. A sweet style mustard, a Dijon style mustard, and ketchup blended with curry, which I'm told is a recent favorite of the German kids brought over from Turkish immigrants. 

For our entrees, we all had some type of schnitzel. That same friend told me to try the Wiener schnitzel as it is the representative item when you think of German cuisine. So all our schnitzel's came out and mine was the blandest. My friend's schnitzels had different gravies, toppings, and stuff and my poor little Wiener schnitzel was just bland and all alone. You have to get that Wiener schnitzel wet with gravy ! 

No biggie, I'm a foodie so I'll eat it. A schnitzel is basically German country fried pork. Not super exciting. I copied my friend who lived in Germany and substituted potatoes on the side for spatzle, as I wanted this experience to be as authentic as possible. I don't know if it's just Haus Murphy's, but the spatzle was kind of bland, even with the gravy. 

I do however like the word spatzle. If I ever visited Germany, I would only say spatzle, to everyone. I also liked the other thing that was served with the entree. It was kind of like a mashed potato mixed with some creme sauce, onions and some kind of green vegetable or herb (probably spinach). 

The beer here was good authentic German beer. I didn't get drunk, but I still don't remember what kind I had, you'll have to experiment. 

Service was excellent. I read some reviews that said Murphy's was slow but everything came out quickly and evenly for us. The waitress was very friendly and they spoke lovely German (not that I speak ANY German, but it sounded sexy). She was very helpful in describing everything, from the food to the beer.

I ordered a BAP (big ass pretzel) to go. Philly is known for some pretty good pretzels and this BAP was good. It was expensive, but it came out warm, soft & chewy. The only thing is they went a little heavy on the salt. 

To steal and modify a quote from a Seinfeld episode: ""That big ass pretzel made me thirsty""!  

Note* They don't actually have it on the menu as a BAP.

Would I return to Murphy's? Ehhh, yeah to try some of the other things, but I definitely can't see it as a place that I would be a regular at.",2011-09-12
6225,901,4397,"The boyfriend and I went here on a Sunday morning hung over from Four Lokos. 

The food was fucking great and I don't even like breakfast food.  I got this egg and jalapeno burrito thing with this sort of runny but generally pretty tasty salsa and I wanted to shower in the burrito filling.  I would have bathed in eggs and salsa if only to prolong my experience with this semi-breakfast burrito thing.  I would have married it and had kids with it and bought a house in Michigan nearby a really good school district.  I fell in love with the egg jalapeno burrito thing, I would cuddle with it on weekday mornings and plan trips to national parks with it.  

It was also nice sitting on the patio considering the weather is so pretty and the staff was attentive and friendly and slightly charming with their loafers and novelty socks (is that part of the required uniform I wonder?)

I'm deducting one star for the sheer fact that this place was filled with rich, middle aged white yuppies talking about golfing and/or glued to their cell phone.  The boyfriend and I, being young dirty Mesa kids still slightly intoxicated off Four Lokos, felt mildly out of place in this setting and were a little over whelmed by the amount of yuppie whiteness.

Updates - They mix a great margarita! No fluorescent green pre mixed Margarita mix - they make it themselves with fresh lime juice. Yum.

The wine list is small but good. My current fave is the Argentinian Malbec.  It's only $6 a glass, and they pour generously. Very tasty wine.

The seating is not comfy if you like to slouch. If you sit up straight, it's fine. But seriously.... good posture is over rated.

We saw tons of people with cameras, so it is a photographer's haven.  I really had no clue there were so many types of cactus. There are hands on activities scattered throughout (probably for kids on field trips) and boards with information, which comes in handy on the Sonoran Desert Trail when you want to figure out which mountain in the distance is Camelback, Piestewa, Four Peaks, etc.  We saw little lizards, hummingbirds, quail, and ground squirrels while wondering around as well.

There is much to see and you can get through the gardens as quickly or as leisurely as you would like. We spent about two and a half hours there, which I think is a perfect amount of time.

To get to Food Truck Fridays in Downtown Phoenix!

I know that all you business Yelpers go out for lunch on Friday's, it's basically a rule if you sit in an office, a cubicle, or behind a desk somewhere from Monday through Friday; don't believe me, check the company hand book you were given on your first day of work. Somewhere between how to comb your hair, what you shouldn't wear, and please don't come in smelling like Nair, you'll find it. While Yelping about your Friday lunch is purely optional, I certainly hope you do ;-)

During your weekly 1 hour exodus into the space beyond the cubicles and plaster walls, ending up in the open air of Food Truck Friday will kick off your weekend right. It's not just for Burger King people, it's time to get it your way! 

Pick your favorite food from, Gourmet Hot dogs with Short Leash, or Mexican with Luncha Libre, Smoothies and Salads with Mojo Bowl, to Pies with Mama Toledos, and Creme Brulee with Torched Goodness. Bring your friends and your favorite gal; they can choose their own favorite too. Don't worry about bringing cash, everyone here will swipe your plastic just as easy.

This is your lunch hour, kick back and forget about work while you're here, if only for 45 minutes. Listen to the DJ's spinning popular music through their thumping sound system while you dine on your fine food. Chill out in the seating area which is cordoned off with misters, fans, and swamp coolers; bringing down the temp from a roasting 108 to a palatable upper 90's. 

This is your Downtown business Yelpers, it's time to kick off those business casuals, and make Friday lunch your own!",2012-06-20

I work a block from this location, so I have been there at least a dozen times. While not great, it is something different once in awhile, so I put in an appearance now and then. The food is not bad, per se, it is just not that good. The prices, on the other hand, are far too high for what you get. $11 gets you a ""large sandwich"" which is not very large, an order of fries, and a soda--RC brands. For a couple of bucks more I could get a combo platter at Famous Daves.

1354,1046,1174,"My wife and I have made two trips to Roberto's from Dana Point, CA (400 miles) and we haven't been disappointed.  Although its not the only reason for our visit, a stop at Roberto's is a must when we're in the Phoenix area.  I have tried, and thoroughly enjoyed the al pastor tacos, beef chimichanga burrito, and I really like the way they crisp up the carnitas.

My wife judges a Mexican restaurant by the quality of its chile relleno and says this is the chile relleno she has been waiting for: two to a plate, great presentation and delicious.  The light breading allows the flavors of the chili and cheese to dominate the palate as they should.

She also recommends the tortas she had at breakfast. The bread, light and toasted perfectly, hugs a generous helping of carne asada (with fajita style onions and peppers), and if you like, guacamole.  Pair that with a cup of their terrific coffee, or if you have never had Jamaica, a delicious Mexican beverage brewed fresh from flowers, try it.  Either way you have a breakfast you won't forget.

Oh, and by the way, the members of the local fire department showed up to order breakfast while we were there.  If they are eating there, you know it's good.  Just had to thank them for their service.  

This is truly a restaurant where family meets family, Roberto's and yours.

And for you insiders, we both love Roberto's homemade tamales.  Although they're not on the menu, we have been fortunate enough to take some of their tamales home during both of our visits.

I believe tamales are normally made for the sale in the store on Thursdays (check with them to be sure), but they don't last.   On our first trip in 2008 to their old location, we stopped in for lunch (excellent) and were told that they were bringing in homemade tamales that afternoon.  We returned that night for dinner and to pick up some tamales that they kept for us.

During our most recent trip we stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday.  But, fortunately for us, they were making tamales for a catering job the same day and sold us some of their extras.  We again returned in the evening for dinner and to pick up some tamales.

These tamales are just like I wish my (Chinese) grandmother used to make.  Check with them to see when they're available.  They're really worth the extra effort.

Although Roberto's delivers, I regret that they won't come to Dana Point.",2011-11-21
7991,2157,5396,"Walking in to Five Guys, I was rather excited, and was looking forward to my experience. I have never been to a Five Guys before, so this was something new. My first reaction upon opening the doors was the music was blaring. Too loud, at least. The music was classic rock, which I don't mind. After walking up and reviewing the easily understood menu and waiting in line for a few minutes, someone took our order. The order taker seemed like she was having a long day, not seeming very interested in the customer. While taking the order, one could clearly see the kitchen. It seemed kind of like In-N-Out, but everyone was moving much slower. It was as if everyone was moving in slow motion.

Much to my dismay, they did not offer Dr. Pepper, my favorite soft drink. I was surprised that they offered other lesser known drinks, but not Dr. Pepper? Come on. After waiting about 6 or 7 minutes, my food arrived in a bag. A bag? Really? I was planning on eating inside, not take out. Even McDonald's does better than that. Digging through the bag I first took out the fries, which were in a cup, and I took a bite. My first impression of the fries was they were nothing special, and too salty. I like salt on my fries as it adds flavor, but there was simply too much salt. As a result, in addition to the fact that the serving was quite large, I finished only about half of my fries.

Now onto the burger. I paid about $10 for my meal, so I was thinking to myself that this better be the best burger I have ever tasted in a long time. Unwrapping the product in its tin foil wrapping, I noticed that the presentation of the burger was sub par. The burger did not look appetizing, at all. Almost disgusting, as a matter of fact. The cheese was dripping over the bun, and I couldn't even see all the ingredients on the burger. Taking my first bite, it didn't taste bad. A pretty classic American burger taste, I must say. It did taste rather close to Wendy's. 

Upon finishing my meal, I was not impressed. My stomach felt greasy, and I felt the need to go hike a mountain a couple times, which I did, as Tempe Butte is close by. I felt my stomach almost on the point of rejecting it, it was that greasy. Seriously. Overall, Five Guys is way to expensive, unbelievably greasy, and makes your stomach cringe. The atmosphere is nice though, thus the two stars.

Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friend's birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron. It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out. The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom. At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave. My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out. As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident.

 I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of. These people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law.",2012-04-16

I had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well. Didn't know deep fried, greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called 'cookies'. Good grief, the bakery wasn't even good! Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling.

Service: friendly

Food: TRY the faux chicken wings (I crave this)
Kung pao noodles
Vegan chilli fries

Ambiance - A+

Tip: don't order the faux chicken wings Togo. Soggy experience plus they add the carrots, cucumber, celery in the box and close it. Equals the case of raw cooked veggies.

I had a mini Hawaiian pizza on my last trip and was delicious! The crust was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sauce was tasty and the perfect amount. I ate every bit of it with no crust leftovers. That was how outstanding it was.

I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!

I love the concept of Entrees to Go. You prepare your meal at this place and bring them home in a baggie.  Meals ready to cook and no mess in my kitchen = awesomeness! Everything you need to know to prepare your food is explained and if you have any questions they are answered immediately. 

The only downfall...The price w/o a Groupon is a little pricey. Three full size entrees (each entree serving 4-6) is regularly $80.

2. why don't they make the restaurant bigger?
3. does the owner want to keep it small despite the negative experience for MANY people who have to wait for forever or just don't go because they don't want the hassle?

Upon arrival, the space was sparse and very IKEA-ish. Pinks and lime greens dominate the palate. To the right of the counter was t-shirts, rubber duckies and other merch. They do have a brown with orange stripes guy shirt...in XL. I guess big men love cupcakes!

But the real star are the cupcakes themselves...lovingly displayed under glass domes. Carrot cakes, german chocolate cake, mocha chocolate cake, blonde (vanilla on vanilla), chocolate on vanilla, and the special of the day key lime....oh man. MERCY. I kept dodging between the carrot and the mocha and went for the Mocha. All natural ingrediants and VEGAN sprinkles! (But very much all dairy icings, btw). Our lady, I think Melissa, was super helpful and even offered samplings of cupcakes to help us decide. She put each individual cupcake in a plastic bubble and in a cute lime green/pink dotted bag. She noted they do have mini cupcakes for events (OMG) and I would totally splurge for those suckers. 

The only real negative (besides times..I mean if this place was open late, it would be HEAVEN) was the lack of drink choices. Coffee, milk or water. Um..I mean, I dont knew a bazillion options, but even tea would have been nice. I chose hot coffee which was fine. But iced coffee as an option would have been kick ass...or lime rickeys! OMG!

As an FYI, you can leave the strip mall complex and head down to the park and eat your delectables under  a shaded tree on a park bench over looking a ""pond"" like we did. I savoured my 2.95 cupcake, and the icing and cake was perfect. I cant even describe how yummy it was. It was worth every cent. And they arent gigantic, so you feel perfectly satisfied with your cupcake.

100% Natural, 100% Naughty is their logo...LOVE IT!",2007-05-24

I hit another, I want a piercing moods and swung in on a lunch break last week, determined to get this piercing I thought would be perfect on me. 

As usual Jo was absolutely amazing. He brought me back and we discussed what I wanted and when he looked at how my ear was shaped he said that I may want to try something like this (then drawing dots where they would go). He took into consideration my piercing past and said it's subtleness and the petite jewelry would suit me well.

The service was a little bit rock to start off as I think 3 different people tried to take our order, but once it got rolling- we were good to go. 

I had some Sea Bass Nigiri ($3 for 2 pieces), Spicy Tuna Roll ($3-4), Edamame ($1.50), and a wonderful house salad topped with sliced pears and a delicious house dressing ($3).  The fish was all very fresh and clean tasting, but the salad was honestly my favorite!",2011-02-08

9023,1051,5929,"5 stars all the way. 

Let me begin by saying that I'm a big fan of the products. The store is done in very warm tones and the drinks are incredibly aromatic and these 2 things combines seem to make all my stress melt away when I step in the door. 

I'm not a huge coffee fan, but I can order some of the coffee drinks here. I'm completely unable to drink the caramel frappuccino from Starbucks, but I can't get enough of the caramel ice blended from Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.

So now that we've established that I love the product, we can move on to the real reason this place gets a 5 star review--the staff. I've never seen anything like it. If you come in 3-7 times someone will probably know your name and might even know your drink.

Leila is the best at this. She knows peoples names, their drinks and if you come there often enough she even knows which car you drive. She'll see a regular customer's car pull up and she'll have the normal drink ready and waiting for them by the time they walk through the door. THAT is the epitome of customer service.",2011-07-26
5198,1063,3805,"I had such high hopes for this restaurant as I was coming in from out of town and a friend who grew up in Scottsdale recommended.  It was a disappointment.  The food was just ok - nothing special.  The sticky buns everyone raved up - did not come out as an appetizer or even after meal treat - oddly came out with our dinner so it was basically over looked.  The restaurant was not crowded yet we were sat at one of the few tables without a view.  My biggest problem was the flies.  They were everywhere and we were seated INSIDE the restaurant not on the patio.  When you go to an up-scale restaurant to celebrate a special occassion, who wants to be shooing flies away from their food.  It was really disgusting and distracting.  For the money we spent to eat here I felt ripped off.  We ate at the Roaring Fork the next night and it was superb so if you are going to be in the area - you should consider alternatives who have better food, better service and a more pleasing environment - don't waste your money on this place.",2012-05-22

Most of us have ventured to the rock at some point in time. It has always been quite awful, but I had some hope after new ownership took over and renovated the place. It is always sad to see a place that has potential, be complete crap.

Upon walking in we were greeted by a small room used as a bar area, with random bar tables along the side. And whales. And scary looking people. And a DJ...well...kinda...he was playing music from a computer..you know...like you would so at home.

We ordered two beers and sat down. Why not give it a chance, right? Just when we thought that things couldn't get worse, we heard a sound. Like a squealing sound. Yes, you guess right, horrible karaoke ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?! Why God, why?????

4343,294,1127,"I actually really liked this place. The yelp reviews seemed kind of mixed, so I went to check it out myself for Happy hour. First of all, they have Oak Creek Hefeweizen there, which is one of my favorite beers. Its kind of hard to find here in the valley, for me at least! Anyway, the beers on tap for HH were $3!! Thats a great deal in itself. We were with a group so we tried quite a bit of the food off the menu. Let me first just say the two best things are the Mac and Cheese (phenomenal and addicting), and the Buffalo Sloppy Joe sliders. The pork sliders were also good as well as the sweet potato fries. The fries came with this yogurt/tzatziki type dipping sauce which was really great too. After about 9 beers, and a bunch of food, the total bill was only $54! 

Parking downtown is hard to come by, another plus about this place is that, because it is at the Sheraton downton, you can valet your car for free for 3 hours and just get it validated by the restaurant. I just gave them a few bucks for a tip. 

The service is also pretty great here, the servers are attentive. It could also be because there weren't many people there. Oh well, I wasn't there for the crowd as much as I was the food/drinks.

If you are looking for a great value for HH, this is the place to go. Parking is not hard, prices are great, and food is awesome!",2011-03-14

2832,307,2278,"I will start this review off by saying that I would normally have given this place 4 stars, but for a large dog-friendly patio, and immediate water bowls the minute your dogs butt hits the ground, they get the extra star. 

We went today, a Sunday, and sat down next to people that had the exact same dog that we have (a female harlequin Great Dane) and knew that it was fate.  We sat by them, because they seemed awesome and in great company, the food flourished in my eyes.  

They have a pretty decent beer selection, they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bell's Two Hearted Ale (but apparently it's an amazing IPA). I knew I'd love mine, he LOVED his.

We had the Mac and Cheese, which was awesome, but not as amazing as others I've had.  So order it if your a Mac person, but don't if you're not.  

We had two sandwiches for dinner, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak (UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!)  and Seann had the RB&C (an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction). Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others.

Lastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie, per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish.  VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app, a sandwich and two beers, but it was definitely worth trying.

Overall the food would have gotten a four, but the experience with cool people around us, and a great waitress really sealed the 5 star deal.  Now being added into the rotation.  Thank you Main Ingredient! : )",2012-09-17

Here's What we LOVE about Fez:
-Sweet Potato Fries (sooo good--sprinkled with cinnamon by the way)
-Kisra and Hummus!
-The Black Bean Burger (the first time I ordered it, I asked the server: ""Now, is this one of those really bad black bean burgers or does it actually taste good?""  She said, ""I totally know what you mean, no this one is good.""-and she was right!)
-Margarita Mondays (aka 2 for one Margaritas--check out the pomegranate one!!)
-The atmosphere--blue and green tones while still being warm
-The friendly service
-The close proximity to light rail

Here's what we don't like as much:
-The slow service (sometimes it gets kind of bad, I feel like you have to be an active restaurant goer and hail down your server--otherwise you may never get to order, get more water/another drink, or get your check)
-When happy hour ends (I mean, who likes that anywhere?)

1668,1246,1418,"The Vine Tavern (i'll omit the word Eatery as i'm fairly certain this term can't be applied to the food they serve at this establishment) is a vortex sort of culmination hang-out for low-brow Fred Durst clones and future (day-shift) strippers. With that being said, this cesspool of a building hasn't burned to the ground yet so I feel compelled to warn others before they consider spending an evening there.

Being new to the Tempe area, myself and a small group of friends decided to drop in to check it out.  As we approached the-dimly lit building I began to have second thoughts: my bloomy sense was tingling (more on this later). As we entered we were greeted by a lovely bouncer type gentlemen who begged us to pay the 5$ cover.... seriously. We were seated towards the back near a group of teenage mothers and their burly counterparts. We ordered food...

The food arrived in a timely manner, it may have been poisoned but i was too hungry to care. I ordered the mushroom/swiss burger.... 9 dollars-ish. If Mcdonalds ever begins selling their products in the frozen food aisle of grocery stores it might taste something like what they serve at The Vine. I had immediate food regret, my only consolation was the 1$ you call its and the poor old man behind the mic with his acoustic guitar wrapping up his set.

6014,49,4282,"Really good pizza has to be among the most perfect foods in all the world.  Really good pizza would likely be on my last meal request list.  Specifically the roasted corn and goat cheese pizza at La Grande Orange Pizzeria which has to be near the top of the list for all the great pizzas the two us who contributed to this review have consumed.  And that is a lot of pizza.

5389,1220,3920,"Though a couple of hiccups could've ruined the night, Roaring Fork took great care of my boyfriend and me and the food was delicious to boot (ha, boot. Get it? cuz it's western? Never mind).

We were surprised at how busy they were on a Tuesday night, but we were able to snag a table on their beautiful covered patio. The atmosphere was nice, and i was surprised at the range of patrons (a family of 5 with 3 fairly young children at one table, and a 10-top of blue hairs right next to us). Our server Charlie was very nice and helpful when it came to selections (from wine to food). We are trying out places in prep for a family visit, so we want to make sure we get a good sapling of the menu.

We ordered a bottle of sauv blanc, and though the wine was delicious, it took about the half the meal for Charlie to bring out the marble chiller. Thankfully the wine started out pretty cold, so no harm no foul. I orderd a bowl of tortilla soup (one of my faves) and I was impressed witht he presentation and taste. The bring the bowl with the chicken and tortilla strips out then pour the broth from a pot right at your table. Helps keep the tortilla strips crisp and was a great presentation. The soup was delicious, though a little creamier than i normally like my tortilla soup. We also ordered the seared ahi with guac and THAT was amazing. The pepitas crackers were delicious and interesting and the ahi was perfect. Great app for sure. Plus, the bread and butter were super delicious too. Garlic biscuits, mini corn bread and pepper butter? so good!

For entrees the boyfriend ordered the bacon wrapped pork loin over grits and I ordered the signature Dr. Pepper BBQ Baby Back Ribs. We subbed fries for asparagus and green beans and ordered an extra side of their green chile mac and cheese. I know, a lot of food, but we planned on taking most of it home. Here's where it got interesting. Or should I say, boring. 

So far everything (except the chiller) had been delivered timely and was tasty. But when we realized we'd been waiting 30 mintues or so for our entrees to come (after they'd taken away our apps), it started to get a little annoying. After about 40-45 mintues, the manager came over and leet us know our tray of food had been dropped and had to be re-made. No problem! I understand accidents happen. But i think it would've done a lot to smooth us over if they'd told us right away the spill had happened rather than waiting until we were about eat the burger off the table next to us. RF did recognize the inconvenience though and completely took care of us when the bill came. So props to them for that, and we didn't even complain or ask for any special treatment.

When the food finally arrived, the ribs were OUTSTANDING. the sauce was perfect, not to sweet, not to flat. And the meat was literally falling off the bone. The veggies were all good, but the really show-stopper was the mac and cheese. The crumble top was delicious and the cheese was melted and runny but not stringy or clumpy. Spicy from the green chiles but perfectly reasonable. I want another kettle of them right now. So good. The boyfriends dinner was also good, but i think my ribs and the mac and cheese were really the best part.

We boxed everything up and ordered the huckleberry bread pudding to go. I was disappointed they no longer do the pineapple upside down cake, which so many yelpers have recommended, but I loved the bread pudding as a substitute. the buttery sauce didn't reheat very well at home, but it was still very very good and the ice cream was a perfect complement. I would totally order it again. Like a muffin fresh from the oven, still a little gooey.

Overall, i loved the food and the staff was really apologetic bout the ""incident"". The atmosphere is great and i would definitely come back. Next time, the burger!",2010-03-19

At 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, July 3, my wife Marie and I ventured downtown and decided to have breakfast out.  Matt's was on our mind.  We waited outside only 5 minutes before getting a table by the window next to the kitchen entry.  Busy place, but the service was great.  Quick with the coffee for Marie and ice tea for me.  Marie ordered an omelet with cheese and mushrooms, while I decided on the special, eggs benedict.  We both had the home fries. 

When everything arrived, the meal was very yummy.  Marie, in her delicate way, snarfed down her omelet with a smile.  My eggs benedict was on a fresh English muffin, topped with ham, poached eggs, and a yummy hollandaise sauce.  Calories be damned!

The whole meal cost $22.53 + 4.00 tip.

It went very well with the chocolate dessert that my husband and I shared. 
In the reviews, I see that many people complain about the bread and the bruscetta. I have to say that it was wonderful to have a bread with bruschetta  that did not destroy my gums after eating it. The bread was flavorful, soft and didn't feel like it just came out of a toaster oven. The toppings were very tasty, especially the Tapenade,  the Chimmichurri and the Brie with fig.

896,747,809,"I'm pretty much in agreement with the previous five reviews.  A great way to spend the day when it's hitting over a hundred degrees!  It's about a forty-five minute drive from Phoenix.

I went on a Saturday afternoon, around three or so.  So, I missed the huge crowds and rowdy bunch, along with the sun at it's hottest point!  It's about a two to three hour ride from the shuttle drop off point two to the pick up point four.

Rentals are $14/pp, which includes your tube rental and shuttle service.  This is the all day rate, so if you get there in the morning, you can go back again and again.  It's $10/pp without the tube rental.  You can also rent a tube for your ice chest (styrofoam coolers are not recommended as they float away), which is a must as you need to load up on TONS of water and your beverage of choice.

Bring along tons of sunblock and reapply often.  Bring a hat though because you'll be glad you did when you see all the sunburn faces around you.  A few old bedsheets will feel like a godsend on your hot tube, so think about bringing those along too!  And bring along a pair of cheap water shoes or old sneakers because it's definitely rocky and you will need to climb out of the river at the end.  Flip flops or loose sandals are not recommended as you see them floating on by in the fast current.  (Don't be foolish and bring your new expensive sunglasses aka 'spies' to show off because you'll look like an idiot when you lose it!)

And yes, the river is dirty - with river grass, pee, marshmallows, every other kind of food possible, etc.  But you hope with the quick current flowing, that it makes the water less dirty...you hope at least.  And please take your trash with you!  (The shuttle drivers offer decent plastic trash bags for free, so please take a couple with you on the river!)

They require that children be a minimum of 8 years old AND four feet tall before they'll allow you on the shuttles to take you down to the river.  It can be a fast river, but also because of the mostly high school and college aged crowd frequently and dominating the river.

It's open 9 am to 7 pm, seven days a week.  The last tube rental is at 4 pm, and lost tubes will cost you $20 each.  You need a driver's license for every four or five tube rentals.  And no glass containers!  Your ice coolers will be inspected before you're allowed to board!

2514,724,1494,"As a sissy vegetarian, I feel compelled to mention the soup that no one has yet mentioned at Da Vang - THE TAMARIND BASED SOUP HOT POT IS AMAZING!

I don't know if they use any other animal broth in it, because I am willfully ignorant of such matters.  Regardless, if you are a meat eater or a vegetarian, try the tamarind soup, and bring friends.  It is super yummy.

They also have a rice-based soup.  And, if you talk to your server, they can likely recommend some vegetarian/tofu based dishes that will be wonderful.

Everything else is as good as everyone says it is.  Wouldn't be surprised if people got an occasional bowl of sub-par pho; every family restaurant makes mistakes.  I'd recommend everyone try it again.",2009-06-03
1462,1119,1260,"Five Guys is good eats.  We've been eating at this location frequently (perhaps too frequently!) since it opened.

Honestly, I don't think the food here is any fresher than In & Out Burger, but I like the selection of toppings (can you say, ""fresh jalapenos!"") and the great selection of sodas.

The peanuts are a nice touch to get you warmed up for the Main Event while you wait.

I personally think it's a little over-the-top to decorate the place in nothing but rave reviews (WE GET IT ALREADY!!), but the cool music makes up for the lack of ambience.

Since the Zagat announcement earlier this week, it's been mobbed.  Try to avoid peak hours, unless you want to wait for a table.

Five Guys is definitely pricier than In & Out, but I think the selection of ingredients justifies the premium.

3 tips:

-Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids under 10) can make do with one order of fries, though the orders have gotten smaller than when they first opened.

-Ditto for the burgers.  Don't let the moniker ""Little Cheeseburger"" fool you.  I got the regular burger...once.  But the ""Little"" one is perfectly sufficient for me, especially after I load up on toppings.

-Can't decide between the regular fries and the tasty Cajun fries?  Ask for a 'half-half' order and ""POOF!"", you'll get it!

Enjoy!

UPDATE: Gotta drop 'em to 4 stars.  The last several visits, the fries have been soggy.  Once they were even opaque in the center --- not cooked!  Ask for them EXTRA CRISPY!!",2010-08-19
915,270,825,"Postinos a spot for high rollin' winos. 

You woke up at noon and had breakfast during lunchtime, so the next logical step is to have lunch food during dinner time, with some wine. This is where postino's comes in. 

The menu is full of salads, Paninis, bruschetta and a few apps. There is a large by the glass wine menu ($8-$14) and hipster cool ambiance. 

Service here is great, the patio is quite nice with heaters, a fire place and even a few patio furniture loungers.  Great for a date, hanging with friends and conversation.

We started with the Bella Postino $9 Crustini with a artichoke dip and a hummus. The artichoke dip was great as any fat laden dip would be. The humus was ok but I am a hummus  snob.

For our main we had the Vegetarian Panini ($9.75) It was good and moist with hummus roasted tomatoes olives and an artichoke spread, the focaccia bread was well toasted from the Panini press.

We also had the mediterranean  salad 8.75 which is a romaine salad with copious amounts of feta. Pretty good as I do like cheese but maybe not as healthy as one would want from a salad.

For desert we had a crem burle, simple not to sweet and well executed a classic.",2012-01-09
8599,472,5708,"3 Stars only because the house margarita and guacamole was so good.  The food was decent (fish tacos), however the patio atmosphere was a bit sad. I understand this is more of a bar than a fine dining restaurant but the patio tables had no place settings, condiments, etc... Just cheap metal tables and chairs. Also - there was no music out there, just this incessant humming of a back alley generator.  

The service was a bit sporadic out on the patio as well. We were asked by three different servers if we have a server yet. Not much in the way of organization. 

Maybe management just hasn't gotten around to fully organizing and furnishing the patio yet. I hope they do, because they are in a great location and the food and drinks give them lots of potential.",2010-10-17

1906,49,1608,"The Orange is a popular, well-reputed joint in my neighborhood. The Pizzaria is connected to a small bakery and deli. IMO, it's overpriced and over-rated. The parking is usually impossible and often dangerously full of gargantuan SUVs and expensive sports cars. 

There is valet parking available at times that is also overpriced, pretentious, and unnecessary. The parking lot is tiny and I need a valet to park my car? What a racket. Overflow parking is available on street in the bicycle lane (thanks a lot folks!)

I used to have coffee here in the mornings week-ends in the outdoor cafe', but the place has become a neighborhood nusiance. The orange caters to a clientele that largely appears to regard itself as quite UMC. Probably they should be located in Paradise Valley instead of eastern Phoenix.

I give it three stars because the food is good. That can't be disputed. The facilities and the company leave much to be desired though.

I have traded my gold Starbucks card in for this amazingly Delicious start to my day. The iced coffee ( actually, its Toddy, which is better) is amazing. They roast their own beans, and allow the iced coffee to sit over night, creating an extremely potent concoction. The hot drinks, A+++ as well. And, the food? A+++++ (5, yup its that legit).

My problem was the included 90 day tuneup. They didn't do any of the work that needed to be done and gave the bike back to me with my brakes rubbing, gears not shifting correctly, and wheels that needed to be trued.

6677,1122,3803,"I am going to give Aunty Chiladas 3 stars only because I have gone there since I was like 10.  This place has been a staple in the valley before the 51 went by etc etc.  It definitely looks like it has been there for a while and needs a good  asthetic cleaning.  Our table and chairs were sticky and it was pretty dirty outside on the patio.  There were chairs and miscellaneous items on the outside of the restaurant and it needs some TLC.

Chips (flour) are good but salsa has black olives (yuk, personal preference) and the hot stuff tasted like it had vinegar in it.  It has a great patio for daytime drinking.  Overall the food is above average.

I ordered the fish tacos and they were good.  My accomplice ordered a combo with your typical rice, beans, enchilada, taco etc.  The food was hot and good.  It didn't have a wow factor but the price was good and worth the money.

Holy smokes.......The service was awful.  I am not going to mention any names but it was slow in terms of business and even slower in terms of service.  I hope that they do not correlate but they usually do.  C'mon Aunty you are better than this!!!!!!

6696,3298,4675,"Chuy's is one of those places that doesn't quite qualify as a dive bar/restaurant, but is close enough to count.  I like Chuy's.  It's like a mini-vacation every time you go.  Part beach bar, part pseudo-tiki (any place that has thatch palm fronds above the bar gets a star in my book!), you'll feel like you're on a beach somewhere every time you visit.  
It's nice to have one within walking distance to the office, to allow for a little exercise to and from and still have a good meal.  Their prices are reasonable.  I've been struggling to find a lunch under $10 these days, and the Tri-tip sandwich and an iced tea will set you back a ten spot and some change.  The food is good, did I mention that?  The staff is friendly, and they finally did away with the cheap-o' paper towels and put real napkin dispensers on each table...FTW!  
There's an unlimited chips and salsa bar, I like the cabo sauce the best for my chips.  I always add a little Baja sauce; you have to ask for it at the counter, to whatever I'm enjoying.  Today it happened to be the Tri-tip sandwich.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars because even though they have to-go cups, this is Phoenix.  It is 108* outside and the full glass of iced tea I left the restaurant with was gone by the time I got back to the office.  There should be a City-wide ordinance that all restaurants must supply patrons with at least a 32 oz. to-go cup during working hours.  All right, I confess that might be a little much.  The only down-side to Chuy's at lunch I've found so far is having to go back to work afterwards and not being able to enjoy a Corona with my lunch.

 I was feeling nostalgic one day and decided to pop in for a bagel and cream cheese. 
The guy behind the counter was nice enough, I told him my order which came to $2.95 or something just barely under $3.  I had failed to notice the sign which said they do not accept credit cards for purchases under $3. I apologized and said I didn't have any cash and offered to run the the ATM.  The guy behind the counter very nicely asked other lady behind the counter  (the owner? manager on duty maybe?) if she would let me use my card.

We were intially given a server that was not at all confident in her ability to perform her job even at the most basic of levels.  When she was asked about the ""specials"", she shrugged her shoulders and told us she didn't know about the ingredients or sides that were available.  I was still hanging in there and giving this place my all.  Afterall... she could have been new, having a terrible day OR goodness knows what she was going through that day?  Then the baby started screaming in the booth next to us and every server in the place ran for the hills, leaving the issue unaddressed.  PEOPLE!... if you have a crying baby, FOR THE LOVE... take the poor little thing outside and deal with the problem, don't force unsuspecting strangers to listen to it.  We opted for a changed of scenery within the restaurant after five minutes of non-stop crying and were moved into the main area of the restaurant and reassigned to a new server.

She no sooner finished warming my coffee (I use this term loosely, as it was more like colored water) before I glanced into the grill area which open for the whole restaurant to see.  This was the nightmare... I saw a rather large female cook with a tissue paper plug in her nose.  Anyone who's ever had a bloody nose knows that this is one of the few things you can do to passify the DRIPPING BLOOD!!

My life has changed so much for the better since April 2012 when I walked into her office super frustrated with many previously unsuccessful weight loss attempts.   Dr. Roxie was attentive and thorough, and suggested I consider HCG.   I had never heard of it before then, so I went home and did my research.  I was a little nervous, but never felt any pressure and when I decided to give it a try, I felt very at ease being under her supervision.  Now, I'm 85 lbs lighter and feel better than I have in years.   I could go on and on and speak to how wonderful the program, office and Dr. Strand are, but I simply suggest that you consider visiting Dr. Roxie yourself if you are seeking to address medical issues that you haven't been able to solve before.  She does a free consultation and is genuinely interested in helping find a holistic health solution for you.   I never thought I could totally change my lifestyle, but Dr. Roxie definitely helped me find a way to do it and has been a major supporter in my journey, which I appreciate so much!

Overall, very satisfied for the price I paid.  However, I do not think I would pay $200+ a night here.  At that point, I would say it's not worth it.

The entrance is gorgeous and nicely updated. Trendy, modern, yet warm. Love the lit deer heads.  I want them.  It feels like a high class resort when you first go through the entrance.  Once you head to the rooms though, it does seem like an older resort.  However, our room was nicely decorated and very clean so no complaints in that area.

If you are missing your pets from home, be sure to ask for a pet fish during your stay! I asked for one, well, I had to ask twice because they forgot the first time... But soon I had a goldfish in my room which I named Basil.  (Due to me becoming inebriated on one too many cucumber basil martini's... Don't judge)

As for the room/parking, it's very easy to park extremely close to the entrance to the rooms which we liked.  It was easy to navigate in and out as the resort is fairly small.  The room itself, ours faced the parking area, which we didn't really care either way about.  It was close to the pool so that was good enough for us.  However, I will say the bed sucked.  When my husband turned, I too turned and bounced along with him.  They badly need to upgrade to better beds. While not uncomfortable per se, I don't enjoy feeling every teeny movement of my partners.

They had nice toiletries- C.O Bigelow.  I enjoyed those little aspects.

For an hour every evening they had free wine happy hour, which we did check out one of the evenings.  Hey, no one complains about Free Wine!!!  Nothing special, but it did the trick.

Hotel Bar: Had some kick ass cocktails.  Plenty of strength and tasty concoctions.

Biggest Bummer?  The pool area.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty. First appearances are good.  There is plenty of shade from large palms and such and there's an area for kiddies with sand.  However, there is not enough chairs for the amount of guests.  And the guests that are there put towels on all the chairs even if they aren't around, which is not cool.  Suggestion to hotel:  Perhaps walk around every hour and remove towels if no one's been sitting there for awhile?  It's not fair for a select few to have a chair all day, while others are unable to lay by the pool at all.  And while there is plenty of shade, for me that was another downfall.  Almost too much shade.  It was hard to find areas to sun in compared to those covered by shade.  It made me majorly pissy.  Sun is why I came to AZ.

Overall, a great place close to downtown Scottsdale and a walk away from the mall. Perfect for those who want to spend time near the action.  If you can get a good deal here, it's worth the stay. Plus, they have a free shuttle if you want to go somewhere a few  miles from of the place.  (so you can drink and have a driver)",2012-05-02
2924,211,924,"I am in love.  This restaurant does everything a good restaurant should.  Ambiance, service and product were good.  The only disappointment I had was with the hour wait on the Monday we went without a reservation.

My party of four had an excellent time celebrating a birthday.  Two had the short ribs.  Tender to a fault, served with delicious Bar-B-Que sauce and pecan grits.  One had the fillet with a spicy aioli and delicious potatoes.
My meal was a huge pork chop, stuffed with Maytag bleu on a ancho bread pudding.  

For an app I split the chop salad.  It deserves special mention and I do recommend it, but it is not a sustaining salad, more of a amuse-bouche.  For dessert we split the peanut-butter cheese cake, delicious.

The beverages deserve some mention.  The wine list is this restaurants' only fault, it is tooooo long.  There is a smaller, delicious by-the-glass selection.  The beer selection is well crafted.  I had two of my favorite beers, Dogfishhead Chicory Stout, something I had only had by bottle, wonderful.

In the heart of Coronado this little house has been transformed to a true Phoenix jewel!
The food was amazing..we had pork with a pasta and broccoli.  The pork had two amazing sauces that my boyfriend I argued over which was the better.  The pasta was okay a bit of a cumin flavor but great once we mixed it with the pork's sauce.  The broccoli was a great fresh touch.  
The manager came over and spent some time talking to us more about the menu and plans to open another place with a different menu soon.  A must try if you are a down town kinda person!  
The crowd  was a mix of tshirts casual to formal and the patrons ages ranged just as much.  The menu changes with the season so go check it out!  Only complaint I've heard from people I've recommended was the lack of choice if you are a vegetarian.",2011-04-19

3591,2056,548,"Consistent.  Fresh Mint offers a very consistent product. 

This is a vegetarian restaurant with a Kosher designationl. The menu is Asian, with traditional dishes served with tofu or just veggies.  The tofu is flavored/shaped as with it's more traditional dish (i.e. Kung Poa has chicken-flavored tofu, Beef dishes taste more like beef).  Personally, I prefer plain tofu over flavored and they will substitute to your taste.  Also, for GF'ers, they do have some dishes that are GF (no soy sauce--such as curries).  No upcharges for any subs or even brown rice...

At lunch, hardly a seat is available. It's nice to see that this is more crowded than the fast food joint that is closer to the street.  A slight tention can be felt for the business of the staff; however, this restaurant is consistant every time...it's worth trying folks.",2012-02-02
6752,1749,4707,"I want the Garage to do well. It is still a work in progress, though. Three of us visited two weeks ago. We were sat right next to a group of 40 - 55 year old ladies out for a surprise birthday. What's with that anyways. Do you really need to go to a somewhat small restaurant with your pack of ""girls,"" and occupy a large swath of the dining area? Do you need all the paraphernalia (collages, centerpieces, hats)? I was seriously waiting to see a youngish birthday girl. Nope, she was the oldest. 60, easy. Act your age. While you're at it, you are not a size six anymore. Needless to say, it was loud. At least one of the revelers apologized right when we sat. As if that's any conciliation for the volume 11 cackling. 

First off, the Garage has good brewskis. Not a huge supply, but what they have is quality. We had wings and truffle oil deviled eggs. Both were great. I had Schriner's Sausage Flat bread, and it was great. Wife had something, I forget, and said it was good. Friend had some large salad and said it was good, too. Overall, food was better than most. 

So, why the three stars you ask? Service. Why do some cool places slip up on this? Is it because they hire ""cool people"" or friends that don't really want to work? First off, a server (we were seated at the entrance/ exit to the kitchen) dropped a glass bottle of ketchup five feet from my foot. My wife and I had splatter on our jeans and glass near our sandal clad feet. Hardly a response. We were handed a rag. Our server not so sympathetically wondered, ""Oh, they almost dropped a bottle of ketchup on you."" The rest of the night just seemed a little disorganized and not relaxing? Every server seemed in the weeds or confused. Empty beer and water glasses. Entrees arrived and empty app plates sat there.

We were noshing along, so I ordered the spinach dip, which was so salty that I couldn't even eat it. Yuck. I asked the waiter to take it back , and he said ""yeah, we've been hearing that a lot tonight""

News flash, if you are getting a lot of complaints, maybe you should stop serving it for the night.

I'm glad I had a friend's cheese plate to snack on...it is hard to mess up brought-in bread and cheeses.

8819,1033,1302,"Two times a year, you can meander down Mill Ave and the adjoining streets to look at an array of art for sale. Everything from jewelry and pop art posters to handmade kitchen utensils, photography and abstract paintings. 

If you go both in Spring and Winter, you're likely to see a few of the same artists. For the most part, Tempe Arts Festival does a great job of providing variety. Plus, it's fun to wander and look at things you may not have seen before - let alone expected to see at an arts festival. 

This isn't the most exciting of art festivals. There's really no live music, unless you count the occasional melodies of flutes you hear when you walk by the vendor selling his handmade wooden flutes. 

I've been three times and enjoyed myself every time. I wasn't wowed. I never saw anything I couldn't live without. But, like I said, this is a fun event to mark on your calender for both Spring and Winter - even if it happens to rain during the festival. 

I give last Winter's and this Spring's festivals both a 4-star review, for the weather and company were great. It was my first year going, and I was happy to see that Tempe offered the Valley something that appealed to people who really do try and appreciate art. After all, it's a ""consumer"" type of event, geared toward bringing the community and artists together. I can appreciate that. 

I give this Winter's festival a 3-star review. The rain didn't phase me. I can deal with a few sprinkles. What bothered me was the mixing of ASU and UofA fans, both groups beginning to gather down on Mill Ave for the football showdown. Don't get me wrong, I love a good sporting event and understand team rivalry. I just thought it was unfortunate that the upcoming game and the fans' excitement took over the relaxed, casual feel that the arts festival usually has - you know, when you can walk down the street and look at art without running into an impromptu cheer section. 

You see, fans were screaming in the streets - hollering insults to the other team - and waving their school's colors high. (Once again, I understand the fun of that. I just didn't expect it to be all over the streets in the early afternoon. Maybe I'm naive, though.) The fans were a definite distraction from the art festival. Knowing what would happen when alcohol was mixed into the equation, my friend and I decided to bolt. 

Lucky we did. Seems like Tempe can't handle a few rain droplets, for when we were walking back to the car, a street lamp post nearly fell on our heads. Talk about a commotion. 

I'd much rather attention be fixed on the art festival rather than any football game or falling lamp posts, no matter how dramatic both of those things can be.

I s'pose this echoes the old saying, ""There's a time and place for everything.""

9252,2316,2800,"After a night of debauchery with friends, my friend and I found ourselves craving a comforting bowl of Pho. I've been a regular at Cyclo's for quite sometime but decided to branch out and try something new. I was pleasantly surprised with Pho Ao Sen! I am always happy when I enter an Asian restaurant and see Asians patrons...probably sounds a little weird but to me it speaks volumes. The tranquil aesthetics of this quaint cafe made us feel welcomed and relaxed. The decor had a modern Asian feel: minimalistic organic zen with soft ambient music playing - perfect for a Sunday afternoon.

We ordered the Pho Dac Biet Bo Vien- House PHO'nomenal (House special combination of *sliced eye round steak, well-done brisket, well-done flank, soft tendon, tripe, and beef meatball) and the Pho Tai (Sliced eye round steak) and Goi Cuon- Spring Rolls. As with most Vietnamese restaurants the portion size of Pho is quite large and we could have shared. Both were delicious, filling, and had a nice aroma but nothing too overpowering. I've experienced a few places that use a little too much anise, so much that you can't get an overall sense of all the delightful herbs and spices used in this delicious creation. The Spring Rolls had a very fresh crisp flavor and were the perfect accompaniment to the Pho. 

I give Pho Ao Sen 5 stars! Best Pho I've had in the valley, beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff makes me one happy girl! :)",2009-03-12

7394,1592,324,"Copper Star is a great example of adaptive use in the heart of the Melrose curve. Who would have thought that a building initially designed to provide fuel to cars would so work so well serving fuel to humans?

Their coffee is locally roasted and, while not my favorite, is well above average in Phoenix. Their drive-thru is a great feature for those mornings when I'm running late. For the coffee adverse, Copper Star serves chai, tea, smoothies, Italian sodas, and some unique drinks including a black cherry limeade. Foodwise, there is a wide selection of baked goods,including some of the best bagels. They also have decent lunch offerings, such as sandwiches and a tasty hummus platter. But where they shine is their 'home baked' cupcakes. (I've seen Mayor Gordon here on several occasions getting his cupcake fix!) 

Despite being in a converted gas station/garage, the atmosphere is quite a bit more cozy than most of the other coffee shops in central Phoenix. While the sandblasted block walls and exposed ceiling let that building's industrial past peak through, this is offset by rotating art work and selection of comfortable (if a bit dingy) couches and easy chairs as well as small bistro tables and long 'work' tables to choose from. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the owner, Bill, is a great neighborhood resource. He can tell you anything and everything going on along 7th Ave.

Since the other breakfast place they had was only a cafe that served baked goods, I decided to come here to have a proper breakfast.

When I asked what they recommended they immediately said ""the Biltmore Benedict"".  I was easily sold so I ordered one, and a coffee.

Cool thing about the coffee is they just bring you a carafe to serve yourself coffee as you please.  Not sure if this was because the waitress was lazy, but I thought it was nice.

The eggs benedict themselves were not the best.  On one hand the ham that they used was overcooked (ie. jerky).  On the other hand the english muffin was over toasted and too crispy, which kinda ruined the overall consistency.

i'm just going to paste some song lyrics that i feel sum up Pei Wei on McDowell...

Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
I said the truth is here the truth is here

I want more
Give me more
We want more
God damn it I'm back to demand we get more
We want more
I want more and more and more
I want more
We need more
I want more
God damn it I'm back to demand we get more
Give me more
I want more and more and more

[Verse 1:]
I stand here naked as the day I was born
Face to the dawn and my faith in the song
Blood soaking the pages I painted em' on
And none of ya'll will take my place when I'm gone
I'm the pure raw uncut, who the fuck want what
Here to show you sucker ass mutts what's the fucks what
Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me
It's got to be allowed to breathe
Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee
I want more than what your offering me
Songs that make me feel like I'm already free
I'm a rebel in my own right
Ya'll don't want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me
When the game need it I'm exactly what it need
Put the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be

[Chorus: x2]
I want more
We need more
I want, god damn it I'm back to demand we get more
Give me more
I want more and more and more

I said the truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is here
Truth is here the truth is

[Verse 2:]
Not nearly a single solitary soul
Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold
One day it'll have to be pried from my cold dead hand
Until then the big man is gold
Got one lone reason to go on breathing
Climb into the zone of the evening, keep reaching
Just to pull more out the core of the deamon
The people need to see them pure human being
Blood, sweat, love, hate, life, death, joy, pain
Little child running wild striped to the raw veins
Rugged junkyard dog off the chain, barefoot balls out marching in the rain
Sacred war dance suspended in the moment
We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it
Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve
Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:]
Our songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul
Not bought and sold, not all controlled
Bring a little fire when the world get cold
Let me shed a few tears and to me you went gold
People need more freedom
Children need to hear more truth when ya'll teach em'
Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching
Got new seeds with true needs and who's leading
I truly believe every word I've ever uttered on a drum break
Right or wrong, life go on but it wasn't nothing fake
I demand you start listening to the crowd
If not - we gon burn this bitch to the ground

Truth is here the truth is here

5556,182,110,"BBQ has to be one of my favorite foods and when a co worker suggested this place I was all for it.  Living on the west side it was quite the drive but being that I am a BBQ fanatic I had to see what this was all about.  

First off Lucille's has a good location.  Its located by Dave and Buster in the Tempe Marketplace.  The look of the place is gimmicky but in a Famous Dave's kinda way.  They have old school signs, mason jars to drink out of, and all the little fake things to make you seem like you have gone to Memphis or where ever they are trying to transport you.

The service was absolutely awful.  It took way to long to get drinks and even longer to get refills.  Attitude the whole time.  Here is a tip if you want a good tip bust your butt.  Then you will have more money to pay for your tuition (half the staff is college kids).  And do not roll your eyes when I don't want to try your suggestions.  They tell you they smoke all their meats in house im not impressed.  

Now onto the most important part the BBQ.  We had the brisket,half chicken and rib tips with a side of greens and sweet potato fries. 

The chicken was good.  It had a smoke on it and was tender not real complaints.  The portion size was good.

Brisket was dry and you couldn't cut it with a fork.  That tough.  Maybe over smoked?  Portion size tiny.  4 strips maybe 3 or 4 inches long.

Rib Tips were dry and covered in sauce.  Hardly any meat on them.  Most places in the valley load you up on Rib Tips when you order they are a cheap meat.  But not this place.  You get a scoop full.  Boo.

Collard greens were disgusting.  Cooked in some weird pork parts and they were bitter.  Greens are not supposed to be bitter if cooked right!

Sweet Potato Fries.  You can't really mess these up they probably came frozen.  So I would recommend these over regular fries.

The starter of a biscuit with sugar on top was just weird.  WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD.  And the biscuit wasn't even warm enough to melt the sugar I mean apple butter.

7024,1145,981,"I'm working downtown now (new themed list to come soon!) so I'm exploring the area from a different angle. I'm no stranger to downtown/midtown's happy hour and dinner spots, but I've never had to go out and search for breakfast or lunch during the day. 

I checked out Focaccia one morning when I hadn't had breakfast yet at the recommendation of my husband, Myles M, who works right around the corner. He said I should order the breakfast burrito, so I did, because he's pushy and I always do what I'm told. Ok, neither of things are true, but in this case, he had conviction and I obediently complied. 

The breakfast burrito was worth every penny. Being a somewhat recent convert to pescetarianism, I got it with egg whites (cool that they had that option), spinach, green salsa and potatoes. The woman behind the counter made it up right there on the grill and it was warm and delicious. The potatoes were skin-on which gave them a great texture and flavor. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the green salsa had a great kick. 

The hot coffee from the carafe I got to accompany it was airplane-quality, but next time, I'll just grab something from Cartel on the way back to my office. God knows the burrito alone will be enough to keep me coming back to Focaccia.",2010-04-17

619,532,179,"Piestewa and Camelback Peaks are the two boobs of Phoenix. They're real, and they're spectacular. 

Of course, being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other, but this is barely noticeable. Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa, whose nipple... er... summit, is at 2608 feet. Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points, not to mention views of the city. 

Although Camelback strikes me as a funner climb, I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded. Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that don't go up to the summit, which look to me to be worth exploring some day.

Speaking of female body parts, the former name for this peak was ""Squaw"" Peak. This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state. Native Americans are offended by the term ""Squaw"", and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word, it is basically the equivalent of terms such as ""Negress"" or ""Jewess"". In the 1990s, the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism, Barry Goldwater. The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea. They'd rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans, rather than honoring one of their finest citizens.

And so, in this decade, Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue. She gave the sqaw-apologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa, after Lori Piestewa, the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquely-Arizonan Hopi Nation. A fitting end to the debate.

NOTE: Even more fitting, the original name of this peak was Squaw Tit Peak, and I swear to God I'm not making that up to be funny.",2008-02-01

I then ordered the pesto caprese pasta which was soooo good. I'm not big on Italian food but I've always raved about it to like five people since I went two days ago. I'll go back and order the same thing - I'm so boring.

7014,1525,1823,"Pei Wei is always busy, that's gotta mean something right? Wrong. There are restaurants that serve billions yet all they serve is a gross mystery. Pei Wei is no mystery though, the food is cooked in an open air kitchen. Even so, if there were such a thing as Asian fast food, Pei Wei would be cleaner version of it.

Most Pei Wei's are situated in pompous locations where ever there is an AJ Fine Foods, but atleast they aren't located in the ghetto.

As far as the food goes, it is about as Americanized as you can get. So if you live in America and have American taste buds, it will appeal to you. Unfortunately if you want authentic Asian food you won't find it at Pei Wei. I don't understand why they even bother to put chopsticks on the table, the rice isn't even sticky enough to pick it up with. They are for decoration. They are part of the 'fake' Asian dining experience. Apparently, Pei Wei serves food ""manadrian style"" from Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, and China. In the words of Bill Lumbergh, ""Ooo.. yeahh.. I'm just not sure about that."" Having traveled to China I can honestly tell you that Chinese food is different. Apart from the rice, the food lacks vegetable oil and garlic. In China those two ingrediants are used in many dishes and Pei Wei lacks them. When I first started visiting Pei Wei I ordered the Sweet and Sour, but I got sick of it. Sometimes the meat would be tough, sometimes the chicken would clump together all nastily. What I get now-a-days and what I got on this particular day was Mandarin Kung Pao. Even though the dish is spicy, that doesn't mean it has to be dry - and it was. What it was missing was some catalyst to bring out the spicy flavors and make them more vibrant.

The dishes at Pei Wei are family style meaning they are meant to be shared with several people. A dish and a drink will end up costing you about $10. If each person gets one dish, that's a lot of food, probably enough to feed a small village in Africa somewhere. It would be nice if they served each dish in two styles, family and single, large and small. Family style is great if you always visit Pei Wei with your family. But if you are out for lunch with people from work you might not want to share your food with your co-workers. They aren't your family. You don't know them.

Pei Wei is a modern Asian diner that is probably better than most of the mom and pop Asian diners out there, even if most of the food is cooked by Mexi-- I mean Asians.",2010-10-23

8160,9,1682,"Post-annual-review day, I wanted to treat myself to a baller lunch, so Stingray at the Biltmore (BFP) came to mind! And it was a superb first impression!

If you are not accustom to the map of BFP, its located walking distance from the epicenter of everything, but its worth the little cardio!

After stepping through some remodeling projects around BFP, I finally arrived to an artistic, grand entrance.  And what I mean is you are fronted by a very tall, Japanese inspired wooden door with modern trimming.  So far so good! =)

I open up and was greeted immediately by the Host and was offered to sit either at the swanky bar/lounge section or the contemporary, bamboo decor dining area.  I chose bamboo for the lounge seating.

After being seated, I noticed a nice feng shui touch they had was placing a bamboo plant centerpiece next to a little pouring jar of soy sauce and a warm cloth they brought out to cleanse your hands with!  What a great lunch so far and I haven't even talked about the food yet! =)

As always, beverage comes first and I decided on a cool refreshing mango ice tea! C'est bon! It had the right balance, not too much tea and not too much mango! Some places is really awful in trying to get the right balance!

So after spending a good 5 minutes and another 5 minutes and asking the waiter what is popular and not too filling, I opted for the Yakinuku, which is thinly sliced, NY strip steak with sauteed veggies drizzled with seasoned soy sauce.  I was content with my selection--now the waiting.  At this point I thought I gaze around and started to take mental notes on the high-end wall decorations and I mean HIGH-END! Time elapsed and my food arrived.  The presentation was just as good as everything else around me. This place was on a roll! 

Before I dipped my chopsticks in to my glorious protein dish, I had to take a quick snap for my Facebook upload. And finally, I went in for the kill! Très délicieux! It tasted great as much as it smelt great!  BTW, it came with a side of white rice (not sure if brown is an option--didn't ask).  I thought the meat was cooked to a tender perfection with the right amount of vegetables topped with very flavorful sauce.  It filled me up just right.  

I typically do not order dessert, but because I actually had room to spare and this place was on roll like a hot craps game, I decided to order their green tea ice cream! All I can is, perfect, as expected.  I've had this before at other places and its either just as good or a little better.

8284,2070,2406,"Don't know where I should start. Grand opening was on September 17th, 2010. We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30% off.

When I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular ""Chinese"" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky, I thought they should've went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California.

Upon checking in with the hostess, they don't even issue numbers, they only call you by name. So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things. Totally not efficient at all.

Once we finally got a seat, things got worse.

Our ""Har Gow""/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse.

The trademark ""beef internal organs"" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon. 

The BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.

I understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn't fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too. 

I don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food. The idea is definitely novel, but will be a hard sell.",2010-09-18

I was expecting oiliness with hints of flavor, but instead was pleasantly surprised by bold flavors carried on an already flavorful oil.  This place far outshines other oil stores which add flavor essence to their oil.  They infuse the flavors here, making them stronger and more authentic.

Overall, great oil and balsamic vinegar.  Try their food, such as the sandwiches.  And definitely try as many oil samples as you can.  The oil is not too expensive, ~$20 per bottle.  Well worth it if you like to use it on bread or to add some great flavor to a salad.",2012-10-23
7102,1317,82,"Where I live in Tempe, I can walk to the end of my street, hop on an Orbit which takes me to the main Bus Depot or can drop me off closer to the Light Rail stop off of Mill Ave. Not bad, right?

I actually am enjoying the clustering of a real Bus Depot not anywhere near a residential area with plenty of security, lighting, public enough space in an easily accessible location in Tempe. I actually feel safe hanging out here at night and when I ride my bike to the station, all the bike racks face the security and transit office, so never had an issue with my bicycle here either.

The buses themselves are fine, I have had some very bad moments on the bus with the passengers (ie the 1st time I got on a Phoenix bus, a knife-fight broke out and I had to stay for a police report, another time two guys were reading hard porn right across from  me), but its kinda nice mixing with people rather then being in a car-tomb.

What I very much have an issue with is most bus stations. I have had bums passed out (dead?)  on the seat, meth heads, a single sign with no seating in the hot blazing sun (I am looking at you Scottsdale), seats no shade around, fights break out at stations. I try to call the metro, they say it isn't their issue. Call the police non-emergency number, they say its the Metro jurisdiction. For this very bad situation alone, I don't take the bus at night since all the stations near the arts area and central are not well lit, full of sketchy people and the buses take too long to come by (if they even stop). For this I am grateful for the light rail for late night Phoenix excursions. 

Metro still has a lot of work to do, but considering the improvements I have seen with public transportation and bicycle awareness in the past 3 years, it seems to be going on the right route.",2009-09-29

The hubby and I visited The Living Room on a Saturday night, so maybe the whole ""we-wish-we-were-a-club"" thing was just a once a week occurrence, and maybe, just maybe, I am totally un-cool, but we don't plan to return.

Food: Wine specials were fairly decent and priced well. Food was average (3 stars). We had a variety of bruschetta, a tuna salad and a strawberry salad - way too much dressing on both salads. 

Service: It took a long time to get a table (~30 mins), but it was Saturday night and crowded, so expected. Once seated, our waitress seemed more concerned with anything other than serving us. She was not very attentive at all. She asked for my order and walked away. My husband was like ""uh, I kind of want to order too""

Atmosphere: The overall look and feel of the place is pretty neat. It is a smaller restaurant with lots of patio/outdoor seating. Decor is large heavy curtains and many couches, thus the name The Living Room. However, as I mentioned earlier, the music was ridiculously loud. They had a DJ playing music so loud, having a conversation was impossible (and we ended up sitting pretty far from the speakers!). We left a soon as we finished our dinners (didn't stay for more wine or dessert) because the music was just too annoying.",2012-08-09
4849,74,927,"Another great Fox concept!  So glad he opened something in downtown Phoenix!

I hosted a large group dinner in the back room and we had an amazing experience.  The service was phenomenal - they even took multiple photos of our group on 2 different occasions.  

The set menu was fantastic.  I really felt like we got a taste of what the restaurant had to offer.  I highly recommend the beet and apple salad, the crab stuffed chicken and the salted caramel pudding or blueberry cheesecake - absolutely delicious!

9698,123,5375,"Love this place! I went with my Grandma and Aunt on a Thursday afternoon. The weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside. First I like the layout of this place, very open and airy. There are 2 outside patios one street level and then one upstairs. I actually have been here twice so far. First time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists. The servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka, grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend. 
The second time we ordered 3 small plates to share, ahi tacos, artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels. All three were heavenly and very reasonably priced. The ahi was fresh and chilled, perfect for a warm day. The artichoke dip was different than any I have had before, gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl. The chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted, even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips. The mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves. Buttery and melt in your mouth good, not chewy at all with no grit, to most common problem I find. The broth was so good I let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl, soaking up the juice. My martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table. 
Now on to the staff, all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled. All of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server Jennifer. We also met one of the sous chefs, Lennie. A charming fellow with stunning blue eyes, my grandmother remarked on them, a playful Mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform. He swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket. I do believe he is right, cooked to perfection, slightly crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and I believe Parmesan cheese. After our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking. 
RnR is another great place within walking distance from my salon and I am looking forward to trying everything on their menu. If all the items are as wonderful as the first 3 I tried I am in for a treat!",2010-04-07
1791,1029,1517,"I received a buy one entree, get one free coupon for joining their fan club membership so my son and I went this morning for breakfast. Got there around 9am. Greeted and seated immediately in a nice booth. Waitress was quite knowledgeable and took our order after giving us time to peruse the menu. I ordered the Country fried steak and eggs which comes with OJ, country potatoes and toast as did my sons breakfast which he ordered the standard bacon and eggs with an extra egg. We both agreed that the breakfast was OK, both our potato sides were cold. I had a small thick dollop of gravy on my country fried steak, which was quite good but had to ask for extra gravy. Put in a serving bowl it was so thick it wouldn't pour so I used a spoon. I spread it on my Country fried steak with a butter knife much like you would a piece of toast. Weird! Watch out for the coffee. If you are offered flavored coffee it is extra. Hidden charges for everything. In other words, even with the coupon the total came to almost $20.00. for 2 average breakfasts. (tip, cancer donation, etc.) I had to do a double take on the check to see if they included the coupon. Nothing really bad but nothing really good either. I should have known better! Probably not coming back. My son seconds the motion.",2012-02-16
6214,3140,669,"I think the high reviews of Sofrita must simply be a function of the limited dining options in Fountain Hills as this is the worst excuse for tapas that I've ever had.  We walked in and were greeted by a strange, musty smell that remained pervasive throughout the meal.  We should have taken that as an indication of what was to come and left, but based on the great reviews, decided to stay.  Big mistake.

I ordered a red sangria which was okay, but had a strange flavor of figs or dates so I'm not sure if it was just made with old wine that had turned and took on a prune juice flavor or if that taste was intentional.  We ordered the olives, fried potatoes, grilled zucchini, shisito peppers, and four different types of bruschetta.  The olives were, well, olives (tough to ruin those) but also contained some off-putting caperberries that we avoided.  The grilled zucchini was just plain zucchini with no seasoning whatsoever served with a side of what looked like potato salad as a dip, but we never really could identify what that substance was as it had absolutely no flavor so we opted to avoid the fat that it was obviously adding to the zucchini.  The shisito peppers had no spice or flavor at all and were absolutely swimming in oil.  I've never had a ""roasted"" pepper that was so soaked in grease.  The waitress asked if we didn't like the peppers when she noticed that all but a few remained and when we pointed out how greasy they were, politely took them off the bill.  The four pieces of bruschetta were all of different varieties: roasted eggplant; ripe tomatoes; avocado and beans; and grilled artichoke with cheese.  The bread was thick and chewy and none of the bruschettas had much flavor at all.  In fact, I think if I had just closed my eyes and randomly selected one off the plate, I probably wouldn't have been able to tell which it was.  The fried potato wedges were actually the best part of the meal, which is sad when the best item is a simple fried potato.

The atmosphere was severely lacking as there were candles on all of the tables and numerous votives on the walls, but not a single one was lit.  The restroom was extremely dark and was absolutely filled with unlit votive candles so I'm not sure if this was an attempt at saving costs, but had I known this, I would have gladly spared a box of votives from home just to create some sort of ambiance while we ate.  The place is also incredibly tiny so I have no idea where the flamenco band and dancers that other reviews have spoken of would perform.  If anyone tried to move through there, they would literally be bumping into tables.  

While I love tapas style dining, if this were the only tapas restaurant that there was, I would gladly forego the experience.  Needless to say, we won't be back.",2011-07-14

6702,193,4678,"I was extremely excited to try what is considered some of the ""best pizza"" in America..., finding out it was only minutes away from my new office. My expectations may have been too high. Our party of four went for a late lunch, we did not have to wait for a table. 

My fiance and I decided to try 2 pies, the margherita and the Biancoverde. The Margherita pie came out quite dry, not with the wonderful chewy crust that a great margherita should have... however, the Biancoverde, a white pizza with Ricotta and arugala, was fantastic! Incredible flavors, the extra toppings kept this pie perfectly moist and delicious, it was really quite perfect. 
Unfortunately, we had a hair in one of our pizzas, however, that's only part of the reason for the mediocre rating... 
The hair, the 1-2 star margherita, and the non-existant meat selection I can only give a 3 star rating... (I'm a bit of a carnivore, I need more meat!)

1108,402,924,"Cartel is a coffee world unto itself for downtown Tempe, which is void of many non-alcoholic places to hang out.  Situated in what seems to be a motel from the outside and a garage on the inside, Cartel can satiate your brass tax coffee fix and your espresso lust for reasonable prices.  

The coffee is great.  Period.  They roast the beans themselves, know way too much about coffee and are proud.  The espresso, in whatever form you get it in, is rich and nutty.  The toddy (cold brewed iced coffee) is strong to the point of me jittering out the door from a small one.  The teas are various and steeped in a cool manner and timed according to their type.  The vibe can come off a little pretentious sometimes with all their rules and such, but they are selling a great product and the rules help distinguish them from the crowd.

I like to hangout here for an hour every week or so, good people watching, the pretentious guy behind the counter is good to listen to if you want to hear people getting so-so advice that they didn't ask for and my professors come here so it is a good place to catch them not in work mode.

9416,819,6131,"If I could there would be two reviews here. The golf course its self would be an easy 4 star based on price and condition. Customer service would be a 1 star. 

Don't bother trying to be friendly with the pro shop staff, these folks are just going to through the motions of taking your money and doing the least possible to get their paycheck.

The front 9 cart girl is friendly as is the lady working the snack shack on the back. 

Another thing that didn't impress me was being a walk on, renting a cart and being told that they already had 2 carts in that group. I am used to being able to have my own cart instead of riding with a person I don' t know and being subjected to their cart skills or lack there of. Turned out okay but just struck me as odd.

Anyway... I'm a huge fan of brunch (and especially of Mexican/Latin American-type brunches), so I was thrilled to try this place. My friend ordered the Verde Vaqueros, which are their verison of biscuits and gravy. But the biscuits are no ordinary biscuits, they're Green chile beer biscuits (!) with smoked sausage gravy from Schreiners. The biscuits were delicious. I could eat them with anything... or really without anything else. My friend cleaned his plate. I got the stacked chicken enchiladas because I'm a sucker for anything with hatch chiles, and they did not disappoint.

Definitely doesn't have the boring suburban feel which you get along Bell Road only a mile away.  The inside has exposed brick on the walls with sleek looking seating.  Each food item comes out looking like a self made creation from the chef.  I have to say the Marguerite pizza is one of my favorites.  Having a crispy crust and savory flavors that make my mouth want to eat more, more, and more.  But I don't need to eat more because I fill my mouth with a good wine.

The food is great. I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes. I'm not a huge fan of duck, but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing. Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers, mushrooms and ground pork, if that helps you find it on the menu. The drunken dragon is also fabulous, and at $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner, Yupha's a steal. I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago. Yum.

2826,177,449,"So I'm apparently oblivious to the fact that anything with the name Joe is owned by the same person.  Luckily for me, I wasn't stupid enough to order bbq pork again.  Joe's Farm Grill is a pretty cool concept and probably the only decent place to eat on this side of the 202 (since Mobsters INC closed, at least).  There are enough review here that clearly he is doing something right.  Suburbanites love to feel like they don't live in a city and, I'm sure, love the idea of a restaurant with picnic tables and trees.  They must because the place was a freaking day care when we went, with snotty brats running all around and climbing on everything.

Anyways, back to the food.  I ordered a BBQ Bacon Burger.  I didn't bother to specify how I wanted it cooked and it was, surprisingly, cooked to a decent medium-well.  I subbed some sweet potato fries with it and they were pretty good.  Little more pepper would have made them great but oh well.  The wife had wanted to sub the veggie fries with hers but they made us order a side of them.  That side was literally 3 pounds of fried veggies and was way too much for any human to consume.  They weren't really my thing but the wife enjoyed.

This place does a lot of things well but they suffer from a lot of the logistical problems that Joe's BBQ does.  The line is better and it keeps people from getting backed up but they seem to run out of menus quickly.  People grab them, carry them in line, and leave them at the window.  As a result, there are no menus left when people walk in.  I refilled the thing twice while I was standing in line.  Also, the condiment/drink counter is outside and all in a row right by the door into the restaurant.  These weird clusters of people trying to get a drink or some sauce develop and creates an obstacle course for people going in and out of the restaurant.  This leads me to my final problem - the indoor pickup window.  While the summer is long and hot (and I'm sure leads to a lot of people usually sitting inside), the day we went had tons of people sitting outside.  When their buzzers went off, they had to go inside to pickup the food.  The single door seemed to be all sorts of hazardous for people going in to get food and people coming out with food.  Finally, and I know this sounds stupid, but the trash can outside has the smallest opening ever.  You cannot actually stick your plastic basket inside the trash can and turn it over to dump your food out.  You have to pick the stuff up out of the basket and throw it away with your hands.  I just finished my meal, cleaned my hands, and now I have to wash them again because I had to handle a greasy, sauce-covered piece of paper to throw it away.

I know this sounds nitpicky but it turned what would normally be a 4-star peaceful lunchtime experience into a logistically stressful nightmare for me.  When you make it hard for me to get in and out with my food, it makes me feel like you don't want me there.  I know they are going to read this and I know they are going to dismiss it just like my gripes about Joe's BBQ but do me a favor, when you build your next restaurant, hire someone with a degree in urban planning to help with the layout instead of just cramming things wherever you think they will fit.",2009-10-19

I walked in with my significant other and was surprised at how busy it was on a Tuesday night. At first, it didn't click but the entire volleyball team from a nearby high school decided to come so it was extremely busy.

They have some really good specials, but what really caught my eye was the specialty burgers that are $6. Big misunderstanding, most $6 are single patty and have some special toppings. Zipps decided to do a double-stacked specialtly burger. Yes, two 1/3 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings. We got two burgers and split them half and half, green chile burger and sweet jalapeno. Both were extremely awesome. You can get salad, fries, onion rings or half-half (half fries half onion rings). The fries kind of taste like In-n-Out fries, and my significant other would describe them as being better. I don't agree, and I don't disagree. Overall, good food, I can't wait to come back and try something else from their special menu. The $6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8-close and weekends from 11-4.

The service was really awesome. They definitely cared about us and went out of their way to make sure we were doing okay. I think they felt guilty that we were there when a huge group was there as well. Apparently, they also were understaffed, but it honestly did not feel like it. Seriously though, it was some of the best service I've ever had at a Phoenix restaurant. To top it all off, the manager had checked up on us a few times, and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter (pizzookie, or cookie with ice cream).

Now, I'm not a fan of pizzookie, but wow, their cookie platter was awesome. It wasn't on special that night, but I know its on special some other night and at $4 its probably worth a go again. Might I say one more thing about the cookie platter? It's just as good if not better than BJ's.

I am actually excited to go here again. With some really good food specials almost any night, I think if I ever run out of ideas this might be the first place I think of. The food is a little greasy, but I think that is expected when you go to a sports grill. Want to lose 50 lbs, go to subway. Props to the owners for such an awesome establishment.",2010-11-09

For these reasons, I really respect doctors, nurses, and all of the staff that work at hospitals to help those in need on a daily basis.

I've actually been to this Scottsdale Healthcare location three times already in the past eight months: twice for scares with the pregnancy and once for a breastfeeding class.  This is the hospital where my OB/GYN delivers, so naturally, this is where I'll be heading when Baby Mess is ready to enter the world... and I'm confident that I'll be in good hands when the time comes!

I've heard great things about the facility itself, especially the labor/delivery area, from other friends that have delivered here.  And from my experience to date, the staff has always been great as well.  Parking can be tricky, but they do offer complimentary parking during the week... and the breastfeeding class I took was very informative.

Bottom line: I don't think any hospital will ever be at the top of my list of ""fun places to hang-out,"" but if you or someone you know is in a situation where medical help / a hospital is needed, you can't go wrong with Scottsdale Healthcare.  Fingers crossed, I'll still feel this same way after I deliver this baby!",2011-07-26
719,613,656,"2.5 stars really. I've been holding off on the review because I stunned myself by paying $6.50 for a macaroon. Really? I did that! Ugh. It was tasty but $6.50!?!

Now, the spa, on the other hand, is mediocre at best.  The pool is a bit of a walk and available to anyone at the hotel; same with the jacuzzi, which also means the jacuzzi is outside!  Why no jacuzzi inside?  The steam room is small and there is no sauna.  There are only 3 shower stalls, with shampoo and shower gel, but no conditioner. The lounge area is also small and not at all relaxing.  And the robes are super thin (with a chilly room; that's not even nice!) and not very big.  I had to sit very carefully so as to not expose myself to everyone. Hello! haha.

dr karawi is exactly opposite of that (don't know if he has a house in the caymans though). what really, really, really surprised me was the karawi cleaned my teeth....the Dentist! he does that for all his patients. i asked him why, and he just said he likes to get to know his patients. how novel!

The Good: Shannon, California Sea Bass, Michelle (Manager's) Customer Service
The Bad: Fried Calamari, Our last waiter's breath

The first visit to this establishment was our encounter with Shannon.  Shannon was a pure delight as our waitress.  She made our first visit absolutely fun.  My wife had a tilapia dish that she was less than enamored with but I had the California Sea Bass and that tasted very good.  In fact, it was so good that I regretted not getting a glass of Chardonnay to go with it.  The fish had a very nice texture and taste.

Our second visit was our first encounter with the fried calamari.  As our guest so eloquently said, ""If this was my first impression of fried calamari, I would not have liked it.""  The calamari was overcooked and there was so much oil running on the plate.  We called this issue to Michelle's attention and she agreed 100% that the dish was not prepared properly.  She gave us a coupon to come back there and eat at any time.  

However, our waiter's breath was another story. Whenever he spoke, I could smell his pungent (trust me, a lot better than what I really wanted to say) breath to the point I almost donned a gas mask.  There are very few things that would cause me to lose my appetite.  His malodorous breath and the calamari with more grease than a Jiffy Lube accomplished the feat.",2012-06-11
7911,437,5351,"There's a special little place in my heart designated specifically for JoBot, so I'm thrilled to be the 100th person to get to sing the praises of this adorable little coffee shop/creperie/hole-in-the-wall bundle of amazing-ness.

I came across JoBot by accident about a year ago while looking for a late night wi-fi spot to do some studying. It fit the bill perfectly, minus the fact that it was extremely difficult to concentrate with the loud music coming from the Lost Leaf, the interesting conversations that I couldn't help from overhearing, and the endless amount of scrumptious plates that kept parading past me. 

That said, I've made several ""study"" trips to JoBot since. While I may not be as productive as I would be at some of those quieter little coffee shops where everyone has their nose in a book or a laptop, I find that I always walk away a very happy camper, every time. 

Their crepes/tacos are delicious. All of them. Sometimes I feel as though the crepes are slightly undercooked, but once I dig inside to discover the tantalizing flavors that lie within, I tend to forget all about that. The root beer pork remains one of my faves followed by a strawberry/banana concoction for dessert. Yum, yum, yum.

Go here if you want good coffee (the bumble bee is tasty), good eats, good conversation, good atmosphere, good prices, good entertainment, and free wi-fi at any and all hours (they don't seem to close on weekends). And if you're really feeling frisky head down a house or two for some NachoBot. Gosh I love this place.",2012-06-20

There's nothing special about Winco.  It's your typical grocery.  I'm not a savvy coupon clipper or price matcher so I cannot attest to the savings to be had at Winco.  A thrifty shopper I know claims the savings are to be had.

That said there are two negatives that shine brightly at Winco: credit cards not accepted and cheap bags.

Do not come here if your earnings are running low.  I just gathered my weekly groceries and expected to charge 'em.  Not a surprise I was looking forward to after waiting in the long lines.

On my first visit most of the bags were torn up the seam and the handles were split.  For one reason or another the cashier actually helped bag my haul.  How she could hand over bags so blatantly ripped is beyond me.

Being that you're supposed to choose your own food/sauce, including the amount, it should be my fault; however, the nice young lady who works there made my sauce.

The way the tables and booths are set up it feels comfortable, and not crowded.  The spacing is just right.  During peak times, there is a full bar inside to relax while you wait for a table.

We started with tuna tartare, guacamole and chips.  It was a good choice.  We also ordered some beer.  The beer choices were limited.  The table next to us had a pitcher of sangria ... that looked like the better choice.

For dinner we had the short rib tacos and the ahi tuna.  My son had the kids meal mac and cheese.  I've had the short rib tacos both times I've been here, and it's outstanding.

Bun Bo Hue:  Broth didn't even taste like Bun Bo Hue.  Spicy but has no flavor.  Where's the beef shank or hog's feet?  You can't have Bun Bo Hue without the shank or hog's feet.  They use the cheapest cuts of meat.  This item was on their Daily Special.  

Pho Chin Nam:  The broth was super sweet.  You know what that means....MSG galore!!!!  Not even a hint of Anise star in the broth.  How can you specialize in Pho if you can't even make the broth taste right?

Service stinks.  I hate it when the waiter holds the bowl in such a way that his thumb is on the inside of the bowl while serving it.  The dude never refill the water, ask how things were, etc.

Vegetable platter was not fresh.  Bean sprouts were starting to brown.

I have also had lunch here before, some Mediterranean sandwich stuff. The portion is very small compared to the price. Their macaroons look crazy and funky. Have not tried them yet but plan on doing so next time. I almost gave them 4 stars because their hours they are open are very weird. But its okay, I will compromise Essence Bakery. 

They only use butter imported from Normandy in their Croissants. Wow.",2010-09-13
3030,1966,810,"I'm a big fan of Silver Mine. I have been for a long time. In fact, I would venture to say that this is my favorite sub place. Ever. I can't quite pinpoint what is so appealing about it to me. I do know that it was a dangerous decision to decide to live within a mile of this shop. The employees are super friendly, the restaurant itself is clean, the food is cheap and oh-so-good. 

Personally, I recommend the Pikes Peak or Bust which is a veggie cheese sandwich. I love it and have turned into the type of person that gets the same thing every single time...yikes! 

P.S...They also deliver until the wee hours of the morning and it doesn't get much better than a tasty sub when you have been out and about in Scottsdale on a Saturday night :)",2011-11-04

9016,1092,5927,"By far my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Arizona!  The service is always awesome, the place is always clean, and the environment is always welcoming and friendly.  I love hole in the wall, family-owned restaurants because [at least the ones I have been to] there is always a sense of pride in their service and their food.  I've been to this restaurant a few times and have loved everything I have tried.  I like being able to taste flavor, not seasoning, and their Dolmeh appetizer is just that: a perfect medley of herbs, grape leaves, and rice.  

I usually order the #6 - Beef Kebab, but I have tried their #3 - Chicken and Gyros and #7 - Lamb Kebab.  The meat, be it beef, chicken, lamb, or gyro, is always moist and tender.  Like their meat, the grilled vegetables have a perfect blend of crispy and lightly seared on the outside, but juicy and steamed on the inside.  The basmati rice is always thoroughly cooked and flavorful.  The same goes for the Homous, Baba Ganoosh, and Yogurt Cucumber Dip.  I highly recommend their house Combination Platter.  The pitas are always warm and their homous and ganoosh have the perfect texture.  

Try to go around 5p to beat the dinner rush.  The place is always packed on Saturday nights, so show up a little before regular dinner time if you want to ensure seating for your party!",2010-06-23

I ate a piece of chicken, tasted like the grill.  I ate some rice, tasted like the **Burnt** grill. I ate an onion, tasted like the grill.  I are a pepper, tasted like the grill.  I ate the cheese, tasted like a burnt grill with cheese on top.

706,603,645,"Have I got a place for you un-health conscious, frugal foodies out there!  Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices, and much of the food is home-made. There's also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks; for instance, there's over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from. Dennis, one of the owners worked for A&W for 8 years, so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now. 

     I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries, then did a little research. The reviews I saw were all stellar, so I knew we had to give it a try. It doesn't look like much, inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus. But it's clean, and everybody is helpful and pleasant. Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu. We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us. The curds came quickly out of the kitchen, piping hot, served with some tasty homemade marinara. They were a touch greasy, as they should be, and the oil was fresh. Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds. Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu. Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99, $3.99 or $4.99). Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub, with more of that good marinara and some provolone. It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches. Marty went with a double burger ($3.89, the singles are $1 less). He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain, cheese, bacon, teriyaki, or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99). Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.

     Again our food arrived quickly, served in plastic baskets. It became very quiet, except for the occasional growl of pleasure. The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.  The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny, the way I like them. Randy thought they were undersalted, but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement. At any rate, they disappeared quickly. Unlike the sandwiches. They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home. The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious, as was my whole wheat sub roll. The meat balls were nice and tender, and there was plenty of cheese on top. Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste. There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening. It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve. 

     Other food items available: Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles ($2.49), Pizza  
Bread with various toppings, Gyros ($3.69), salads ($1.99 - $3.99), a fish sandwich ($2.49) served with homemade tartar sauce. And lots more. I don't know how Dennis and Steve manage to turn out food of this quality for so little money, but I surely do hope they continue and prosper!",2010-09-07
7150,1504,552,"The first thing I respect about Rula Bula is its ability to attract customers while keeping a low profile. No flashing lights, no 400 pound bouncers with angry stares, and no promotional cards being shoved in my face from down the street.

I walked in and liked what I saw. It has an old school feel to it. There was a live band doing some Lady Gaga covers, and it sounded like karaoke. I wasn't impressed, so I ordered my Jameson (reasonably priced) and walked out to the patio.

It was a good patio, with a DJ in the corner. It had a different feel to it, and I appreciate how laid back it was. But it felt like something was missing. I waltzed back inside, admired a much better cover (of Micheal Jackson) and realized the one thing I couldn't find here. 

FUN.

To a west-sider like myself, Tempe is the Mecca of mischief, a place where I can have one too many and stumble back home with a story to tell. There was a dance floor, but no one was dancing. There were tons of people, but every group kept to themselves. Even though I don't go to bars to meet women, there was a suspicious lack of pretty ones in here. It's like everyone who was too old or uncool to go elsewhere came to have a Guinness in peace.

I came here expecting a fun bar that wasn't a full-blown club, and instead of getting a happy medium I ended up with a boring dive. Don't get me wrong, I fucking LOVE dive bars, but I don't go to Mill Ave for them. Rula is a good place with good history. I can't hate on it.

3125,560,2472,"Consistent offerings of service, food, atmosphere and drinks is what makes this franchise successful. 

No matter whether I've been to Fogo in DC, Baltimore or here in Scottsdale, I get the same gut-busting food and well-made drinks in a place where I could either wear a suit and tie or jeans and a t-shirt.

A specific note on this particular location- there were a lot of families with small children on this particular Friday night. No judging, but I've never seen that at any other Fogo. Fogo back east is really ""date night"" or the kind of place to pre-game for a bachelor party or a business dinner, but not to bring infants and toddlers. Possibly a by-product of its location on Scottsdale Road in a strip mall near a few hotels. IMHO, this is not the place to bring kids, but I respect the rights of anyone to do so. If I was traveling w/ kids in tow and I didn't have a Fogo in my city, it'd be hard to pass up. In any regard, it did not bother me in the least. I was too wrapped up in my company and the food and those drinks. 

You will easily spend over $75 per person here including tip, so prepare to camp out, eat slowly, enjoy your meal and be treated like royalty.

The house special sirloin will make you rethink how to prepare sirloin at home, it's that good. Don't fill up on salad at the salad bar- you can do that at Olive Garden- but do enjoy the cheeses, mushrooms, vegetables and cold cuts which raise the salad bar. Did you see what I just did there?

We aren't golfers.  We came to see AZ.  We were in an interesting spot to do it ... we spent most of our time in the Superstition Mountains and Phoenix and then did one day trip into Sedona.  So from a proximity perspective, if you are interested in seeing more than just the Grand Canyon, it's a good spot.

Regarding accomodations, we really liked our little condo.  Although the furniture selection was a little random (like why have a love seat but no sofa), it was definitely adequate.  The beds were comfortable.  And we LOVED having our own private hot tub.  We discussed several times that we should maybe install one at the house!!  It was just great to get in a soak after a long day of touring.

We also really liked the restaurant on site.  There's not much to choose from in terms of eats in Apache Junction but the Kokopelli's was really nice.  I had a delicious salad with strawberries, blue cheese, and grilled chicken one night and fish over pasta the next.  Both were fabulous.  There was live music and the service was really good.  We met some super interesting people and so the conversation was flowing.  It was just a really enjoyable place to spend a night under the AZ sky!

One kind of crazy thing that happened was there was a huge mud slide that wiped out part of the golf course and filled the parking lot.

I figured out why I never liked Chinese food when I first ate at Asian Cafe Express. It's because everything I've had has been Americanized Chinese Food!!!  It was like an epiphany and seriously music to my tastebuds when I actually found Chinese food I not only liked, I LOVED! Having authentic Chinese food changed my opinion completely about this cuisine.

I have to agree with the others... save yourself the time and skip the first few pages. Go straight to the back of the menu to find authentic Hong Kong Style fare. Holy mother of god, everything I've tried has been outstanding and each time I leave saying it was the best meal I've tried thus far.

900,751,812,"One of the better places to get some frozen yogurt, and since this is the location closest to my house, we tend to come here more than any other place we have been to so far. 

There is no indication next to the names of the yogurts what ingredients are in it, so I am docking a star for that. I'm trying to avoid eating eggs as much as I can and it is always helpful when that information is available without having to ask. I have been on the website enough times now to know which flavors have eggs and which don't so its not a problem for me anymore, but for anyone else it would be. But the flavors I have had have all been good. The fruity pebble flavor I had awhile ago actually tasted just like the cereal. It was a fun flavor. 

The topping bar is a good size. There are fruits, candies, and nuts among other toppings. My husband and I are generally happy with this topping bar. 

The best thing about this location is on Wednesdays, if you come in wearing pajamas (or something resembling pajamas) you get 50% off your total! Its a great deal. The last time we only paid $5 for the two of us. It gets pretty busy on Wednesdays but its not too bad.",2011-08-24

I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.

It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table. The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee. The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone. 

The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee. I don't know how I have overlooked this place but based on the experience today, I would put it right at the top of best spots in town for breakfast.

If you know me well enough, you'll know my first thought when we walked in was ""is there booze???"" The answer is yes. I recall seeing your typical breakfast bevies such as mimosas, bellinis, bloody mary's, etc.

So you go in, scope out the menu, order at the counter, and they bring you your meal and beverages. I ordered a simple eggs, potatoes, toast and sausage breakfast, and my friend had an omelette. We had just had brunch at Maizie's the day prior and our first impression was disappointment in the portions of the food, considering the prices were also comparable. Oddly, my sausage, potatoes and sunny side eggs had the same consistency, so that was off for me. They were all a bit soft and soggy. We, of course, enjoyed the mimosa and bellini, but $5 each is a bit high considering they're $3 @ at other places, and Cafe Boa down the block offers unlimited mimosas for a fixed fee with food.

Decided to go fairly late Saturday before they closed and at about 2pm the place was pretty packed. Was given a choice to sit at the bar which wasn't a problem. Impressed by the transformation as this location used to have a Tokyo Express which I would go to at least once a week. I was joined at the bar by 3 other people and given menus. Only issues I have with my whole meal is that they should have decided the bar so that people can put their legs underneath because the meal required a bit of gymnastics to fit comfortably. Other issue, but one I can forgive is that the 3 people next to me were asked what they wanted to drink, Koolaid, and somehow I became temporarily invisible and wasn't. Took about 5 minutes for anyone to bother to ask. I can't blame though because the place was busy and I who doesn't want a new place to be successful when the food and atmosphere are good.
Ordered the Betty Boop (chicken and waffle, and so did the 3 other people next to me...I have that effect on people). Chicken breast and waffle were delicious and I definitely had a sugar high from the 2 gallons of Koolaid that were served to me. I'll make a note to maybe go for some Diet Coke next time.

sashimi - Good, not great. Could of been a bit colder.
spicy tuna roll - better than the sashimi but not epic.
soft shell crab roll - this was actually my favourite tonite. It had the right amount of texture and flavour.
fake and bake - they must of used some sort of torch to brown the top, probably powered by lighter fluid as all I could taste was the burnt part on top. Would of been fabulous if they didn't try to set the food on fire.

Anytime we go dining with children under 13 in tow, this is always a great choice.  The kids eat, they play, they tire themselves out and they come home with a bunch of cheap crap they bought with their tickets that cost me triple what it would of cost at the dollar store with regular grown-up money versus tokens and tickets. Anyhow.....

I'm a fan of this particular location because:

1) The place is spacious enough that you are not run down by little people on your way to pick up your order. 
2) They keep tables, play areas and restrooms very clean.
3) Service is satisfactory.
4) Play area, arcade games, carousel are all in great condition - nothing torn, falling apart or borderline condemned like other Peter Piper restaurants.
5) They have several 32 inch TV's hanging in case you want to catch a particular game while the kids are playing.
6) And, again, the pizza is really not that bad.",2011-08-12
1028,50,914,"I Love this place. I eat here either take in or take out at least 2 times a week!

I also agree with some of the others. I love the fact that I can try something new without committing! I love the revolving sushi. I also do not like that there are a lot of spicy selections. Why not offer the spice on the side. I would love some of the sushi, but it has that spicy sauce on it.

Some of the best to offer that some people might not know about:

Haru sushi - Tuna stuffed with crab and topped with avocado!
Hand rolls - YUM!!! Some are only 2.50
Udon - Good!

The staff is great. The wait can be long on some days or eves.

4660,1368,3472,"So I'm not a big Chinese food fan, but my husband is. Truth be told, it usually makes me sick. But if I were to go to Chinese food, Dragon Palace would be one of the places that I would go. The food is decent and there's a lot of it. I really felt I was getting my value's worth.

The waitstaff was attentive (always there asking if I wanted a refill) and the food came out quickly. It looks like every other Chinese food restaurant in the world (lots of red and gold, lanterns, paper Chinese Horoscope place mat -- save for the deep teal walls).  I'm not sure I would make a long drive to Dragon Palace because chances are you have a comparable Chinese food restaurant nearby, but if you live in the 32nd St. and T-Bird vicinity, this is certainly a Chinese food place worth trying. 

As for the food, we ordered the Peking dinner for 2 which came with won ton soup, a pu pu platter (consisting of won tons - yum -, eggroll, a small fried shrimp, a skewer of glazed beef and honey chicken), Peking fried rice (fried rice with shrimp, chicken, pork and beef), Mongolian beef and the house chicken. (as an aside and a disclaimer, I am preggers right now and I have developed a severe dislike for chicken which means I, of course, hated the chicken dishes). My husband thought it all was ok. I really liked the won ton soup and the Peking fried rice. After dinner, we got the requisite fortune cookie (""Express yourself now."" WHAT?) and a really yummy banana wrapped in a won ton and fried with a sugar glaze thing.

All in all, it was a good time at a pretty good Chinese Food Restaurant.",2010-06-04
8018,3676,1913,"Cesar Chavez park is the best that the SW Valley has to offer! Located at 35th Ave & Baseline at the base of South Mountain, it's a great location for the residents of South Phoenix and Laveen. I've seen it very busy, but it also seems to be one of the best kept secrets in SW Phoenix!

There is ample seating throughout the park, including ramadas and benches. A 1.1 mile trail wraps around the lakes in the center of the park, making it perfect for runners and walkers. There is a small tot lot and playground on the east side of the park that families will enjoy. No matter what time of day you visit the park, you will find people around the lakes fishing. Be careful- a friend once tripped on a fishing line that a careless fisherman didn't remove from the sidewalk and broke his elbow!

Drawbacks: this park is always dirty, as no one seems to clean up their trash after visiting and it is not safe in early morning or evening hours. Otherwise, enjoy one of the better city parks!",2012-04-09

 We started off with the jess Jess boneless wings- Delish!!!!! Not wet like other wings in fact I think they coat them and then throw them on the grill. We Loved them!

Got the ""homemade"" ceviche and the carne asada taco.  Thought the prices were a bit high for the quality and amount of food that I received.

The ceviche and tortilla chips that came with it were a bit bland.  The carne asada taco was good but not spectacular.

What got me though as I sat indoors in their dining room was I started to notice how dusty everything was.  There was a grimy layer of dust over all the decorations on the walls and the tops of the condiment bottles were frankly disgusting like they had not been wiped in ages.

So I decided to check out their bathroom.  Sure enough, the ladder they had leaning against the wall had a layer of dust on them . . . .

2741,1831,2166,"Ahhh.... Whole Foods, John Mackey's little baby he has turned into a behemoth within the industry. I am so torn by Whole Foods, of course most everything is more expensive. This could stem from when Mackey started the business as a democratic socialist and was not making any money, yet people were complaining about pay and high prices so he then turned into a free market libertarian - you can blame your high prices on that if it makes you feel better. Mackey is also a Vegan, but has said if he didn't sell animal products it would be bad for business(if the business even existed), yeah I get it, but I don't like it. Does anyone even care about the innard workings of the company CEO of the store they love/hate? Ok I'll cut this short.

This Whole Foods is an older store, not the real old school hippy-esque store, but it's nothing like the newer flagship stores around the country(like the one on Mayo). This obviously means they have to cut back on their selections to a degree but they still do a good job of cramming everything into this much smaller, albeit more ""quaint"" store. If I go to the Mayo store I am gone for 2 hours but only come back with a bagful of stuff because I was lost in a trance ""browsing""; this makes my girlfriend very angry.

I don't buy all my groceries here because I don't think some things are worth what they charge but in all honesty you can only find certain things at Whole Foods that you can't find anywhere else(Trader Joe's, Sprouts, Sunflower, etc). The Vegan/Vegetarian selection is massive compared to those other stores, they simply carry all the latest and greatest - it may not be the cheapest, but they carry it. 

One last item, and this is for pizza loving vegan fools - Whole Foods was one of the first places to carry Daiya cheese. They actually sell shredded containers of it in the refrigerator section, but they also have it available at the deli. The usual counter worker isn't that friendly which is a shame and always seems put out but that doesn't make the pizza any less tasty. You can get one of their ""surfboard"" pizzas which will feed 2 for 2-3 days with a couple of toppings with Daiya cheese for $15.99. This may be the best deal going at Whole Foods and make up for that $8 bar of dark chocolate you just bought.",2010-01-27

They brought us the great basket of warm breads, we ordered bottled water for all and a bottle of some 06 Sauv Blanc that was mighty tasty. It was impossible to have an empty glass this night!

Everyone had fillet's but me of course, I mainly had apps, side's, wine and desert ;) I did try the seared ahi tuna it was ok I wasn't too impressed with it though.

6634,2435,1817,"Slices or Spinato's? When you're near Tempe Marketplace and don't want to miss the movie you are about to watch you should check this place out. Slices is more of a ""New York"" style pizza where as Spinato's is more of a homemade style pizza, and I don't say that with any disrespect. In fact, if I had to suggest one of the two places I would most definitely suggest Spinato's. I'll try outline my reasoning behind this choice.

Slices just has their ""NY"" style pizza, and to be quite honest they don't even do it that well. There are tons of places in Phoenix that do ""NY"" style pizza, and a notable place is Venezia's on Southern and Mill, not too far from Tempe Marketplace. Spinato's does have an ""NY"" style pizza and a Sicilian pizza, and the latter is actually pretty good.

On a Friday night, this place gets somewhat packed for dine-in, but you can order ""eat-in"". So basically, you order you food, wait to be seated, and then shortly after being seated you can get your food. This worked out pretty well. The service is also good, and the staff are pretty friendly. Bathroom was small, one bathroom for the whole place, but it was clean and well kept. 

The pizza was very interesting, we got a Sicilian ""Traditional Vegetarian"" pizza. Essentially, if you could compare it to another pizza it'd be DiGiorno. Seriously though, the pizza reminded me a lot of DiGiorno's frozen pizza. This place has a unique homemade feeling to it, and even the pizza. I'm not saying its bad, its just unique. The crust is actually delicious, and I usually don't care too much about the taste of the crust, but this one actually tasted pretty good. The downside though is the way they served it, nothing to pick up slices with, and it was super easy for toppings to slide through the grill when it was warm. It became somewhat of a pain to handle the first few slices. 

This place has serious selection issues. Let's see, pork, pork, more pork, and a little bit more pork, oh and a little bit of vegetarian stuff. Ok, so where does that leave kosher meat eaters? Not at this place. If you eat kosher meat, and enjoy it on your pizza, this is not the place to come. There is literally no chicken or beef available here in terms of toppings.

This place is pretty good and moderately priced. My significant other and I shared a 14"" sicilian, and got waters which totaled to something like $15. Certainly not a terrible price, but for the price I think we could do a little better. I suppose if we wanna catch a movie after dinner we would visit this place, but it is certainly isn't on the top of our pizza visiting list.

12/10/07 - What's the first thing I do when I arrive in Phoenix? Punch in 2240 N. Scottsdale Road in my GPS and head to Green! This time around I had Thee Argentine Po-Boy with fried - Mock steak fried with onions and peppers, vegan mayo and a spicy sauce. I couldn't get enough! Very delicious

12/11/07 - After having a veggie burger and fries for lunch at a Hard Rock Cafe, I thought I'd balance it out by having something healthy for dinner - I ordered the Diablo Rice bowl with chicken and brown rice. The description looked good: veggies in a spicy sauce - but it was a little too salty for my taste and didn't finish it. Oh well, can't win them all.

12/12/07 - I was working close by, so decided to run in for lunch. I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich with a side of tahini coleslaw. It was a little bit messy to eat by hand, with the tomato sauce and soy mozzarella oozing everywhere - still good nonetheless. The coleslaw was a nice compliment to the sandwich.

This resort truely is a Sanctuary--the pool, complete with negative edge, in-water matching rafts for guests, and a top notch waitstaff was my favorite spot.  Had a gotten a chance to experience the spa, which I've heard is one of the best in town, I may have taken up residence there.

I stayed here as a reward for work with a bunch of girls--we had a suite--a sweet suit eactually, complete with 3 bedrooms, kitchen living room, etc.  We even had a cute bellboy who watched parts of the NBA finals with us.  Now thats service.  

Plush robes, a balcony with a perfect mountain view, and egyptian cotton sheets.  Loveitloveit.

At night we went to Elements which is the very up-scale restaurant and bar at the resort.  It deserves its own review so I'll write a seperate one, but know that its exceptional and the view is amazing.  A great date spot for even those who aren't spending the night at the hotel.",2007-09-04

Nor have we forgotten the fabulous and uniformly cheerful staff.

However, I was craving this cuisine and this restaurant is close by and tucked away in a small quiet strip mall. Wasn't busy at all on a Friday evening. We were greeted right away as we entered into the clean, open, no frills dining room. We ordered beef and broccoli, chicken fried rice and lo mien. As we waited our super friendly server offered bowls of egg drop soup on the house. The soup was a nice touch but nothing superb. I was satisfied with our meal but it was not the best I've tasted. Fried rice was a little bland. Beef and broccoli was delicious. Overall I'd say the service was way better than the food.",2012-04-14

The rice and beans are also very good. The salsas and guacamole are also awesome. One is smoky while the other has great tang and spice. Nothing, however, outshines their delicious tortillas.

4302,1537,1158,"Went to the Rooste for a Christmas Eve dinner among a small group (9) friends. I had never been. Had heard the name many times over the years when I had previously lived in Tempe. 

Been intimidated that by where it set that it was expensive and swanky. That's all a lie! It sets up high and has a wonderful view. It's not located where you are just strolling down the street and decided to pop in that is true. You wind through these grounds to the back of the property pass beautiful fountains and buildings until you come to the lite up restaurant. You can self park but why bother go for the valet. 

You pass a smelly ranch steer at the entry that is probably wondering why the hell its there as much as I was. Inside the door the smell escapes you immediately, thank goodness. You see some young sap making cotton candy and wonder what the heck have I arrived at. A few more steps and you see you are in a western theme establishment, by the overwhelming amount of raw wood beams and flooring. 
First stop the bar. It's a limited full bar and for this it losses a star. 
From the bar the view outside is great and you can look down and see the country music band playing (it was a band but I wouldn't book 'em) but hey they gave the place a little extra pulse. You see the staff in casual western gear also and you instantly know you're welcome in your jeans. 

Moments later our table was ready and half of us choose to take the slide down to the dining floor and the others took the steps. Hey I went for the slide! It was short and fast and another reason to come casually dressed. 

Our waitperson was a delightful and articulate young woman. We skipped the appetizers to leave room for dessert (next time I'll reverse that decision). The menu was very good. Several steak cuts, enchiladas, fried chicken, BBQ beef & pork ribs, Seafood, a burger, pork chops, most plates $15 - $20. 

While waiting for the salad course a magician name Flash comes up and asks if we'd like some magic that night (he works for tips). He went about his tricks and blew our minds! THIS GUY I WOULD HIGHER for an event. Never figured out how he did what he did but would love to see him doing it again and again. So if he comes by your table take him up on his offer of magic. 

The food arrives, the salad is good and fresh the main courses come and all are cooked to perfection. My medium rare T-Bone was actually medium rare for once! My steak was tender and taste fabulous. The food didn't hold it's heat well and they serve sweet potatoes or rice with the dishes rather than standard baked/mashed or fried Idaho's (extra charge for a standard potato - why? - Minus another 1/2 star). But over all it was a good meal. We barely had room for the dessert so we split a 9 layer chocolate fudge cake and another dessert among us. And we still had four or so layers of cake left to go home! It was so rich and such a huge slice no 3 people could have eaten the entire thing following a meal if they tried... 4 of us dug into this slice. 

All in all it its a great steakhouse. Prices lower than Lonestar and Steak portions (ounces) bigger for your money, plus a better all over food and appetizer menu by far. Oh yeah I'm a fan and will be returning again and again when I want a steakhouse to fill my steak cravings and a bit of entertaining to accompany the meal. 

I highly recommend Rustlers Rooste.",2009-12-27

3999,1649,761,"Still love their product, but their online ordering process just doesn't work.  First time, my order was sent to the wrong market.  Second time, I was shorted a package of chops.  I checked the bag before I left the market, so it was only a minor inconvenience.  Third time I ordered bacon, which was listed as available on the web site, and then contacted and advised it was not and may not be available for a few weeks.  Since I paid upon ordering, I had to go through the hassle of waiting for a refund.

I've also noticed inconsistency in portion size which is a problem considering you pay by product, rather than pound.  Boneless chops should be roughly 6-oz each, yet I've received 4-oz chops at times, resulting in 50% less product for the same price.  Not a deal breaker for me, but something to consider.

I continue to purchase from these guys regularly, but no longer try to order ahead.  And I do wish they would have bacon available more often!",2011-03-08

The hotel has two hot tubs, one that changes colors at night and is next to a man made stream, the other is on its own ""island"". There are two pools, a lazy river, and a small pool. The rooms were comfortable and the whole facility was clean. One thing that must be commented on is the staff was not only efficient but they were very friendly and nice. All of the food and room service I ordered was filled with superb flavor and had good presentation. The hotel also has a botanical garden, herb garden, multiple lawns, and it contains different food services. I highly recommend the ranchero pulled pork tacos and the sushi. The Marriott burger, creme  brûlée, drinks, and fromage board was very good.",2012-08-18
9750,303,2804,"Agree with everyone on here, this is some really good food.  Very laid back un-asuming place inside another strip mall on Bell Road.  Ah what treasures lie hidden in a strip mall....

We were greeted by a friendly young man who took our order right away, I ordered, well I don't quite remember the name,  but it was steak pieces with french fries and onions, and rice.  I was fooled by the mild salsa that came with the chips and said, ""hey can you make my dish spicy?""  The server said no problem, and while the dish was very fresh, my mouth was on fire, and I touched  my eye and it was like pepper spray or something.  I love hot food, I can eat Los Dos Molinos Abogado ribs for example with little problem, but this stuff kicked my butt!!  It had little red peppers in it that I have never experienced before. HOT!!  I kept remembering Deb's review:""....this is not Mexican food...."".  No kidding, next time I will get it milder.  My eye burns still.....

Wife got a milder flat pan steak dish with lentils and rice.  She praised its freshness.  We also split a red beef tamale (they were only like $2) so it was just a sample but decent.

They only have 6 tables in there!  And they had to change their name due to copyright infringement from a restaurant  in Texas according to the young man.  Either way, we will be back for sure.  Good stuff!!  Something tells me there is more burn to come, perhaps tomorrow if you know what I mean?  Beware!  They can really spice it up if you ask them too.  I met my match at Mi Comida....

Fresh ingredients, nice people, and a nice change from Mexican food.

Recommended!  Don't touch your eyes if you touched those little red pepper things, that is for sure!!",2010-02-24

6751,750,4706,"I have been to Hong Kong many times but this is my first review. I must say every time I go, my belief that this is the best buffet in the Phoenix area is reaffirmed. Hong Kong is very consistent with their food quality and the service is always been excellent. I do agree with other Yelpers that you can find other buffets that are cheaper but you get what you pay for. My favorite feature is the sushi station. My wife is not a sushi fan so when we go to Hong Kong, I hit this station several times. The only problem is if I fill up on the various rolls and sushi pieces, I don't have room for all of the other wonderful items Hong Kong prepares. The only station I can't comment on is the Mongolian BBQ station. Again, it comes down to a lack of room more than a lack of will to try it.

Good sliders, fish was below average BUT the Wedge Fries are awesome!! The fish itself was OK, but the breading was watery as if steamed from the inside!

The order system is like Pei Wei, line up and order at the counter get a number and sit down. Bad news, the wait was long, the good news, the food is great. I guess, I revealed that I'm impatient and want instant gratification. Thank God that they gave me a cup for coffee after we ordered and got our number to pin on the table on those ""Alligator Clips"". Every time I use those things, I flash back to the early 70's using those clips for that last toke that then gave the super munchies.

Coffee, $2.50 a cup for a bottomless cup with plenty of choices and in a to go cup. Atmosphere.....very hip look, open ceilings, nice patio, great colors and great sayings on the wall to remind us of cool sayings to remember while we nosh. Breakfast came pretty quickly considering how many people were in the restaurant . I had a breakfast burrito that was plump and was plenty of food. I just hoped for more....maybe those alligator clips reminded me of the munchies of the 70's. Sandra had a cinnamon roll and although I thought it could have been bigger....she enjoyed and said ""It was fine and filling"".

Today was the tip of the iceberg and I will not be going there again. The past 2 visits have proven to me that their customer service has rapidly declined.
 
I understand that every business needs to ""Upsell"", but it becomes an annoyance when they keep bugging me 5,6,7,8 times after I have said no. Don't even get me started on their glass repair salesmen....

I always get the Premium auto wash, a few weeks ago I went and when I got home I noticed they had not cleaned my dash or center console (which is included in premium). I also noticed they had not wiped down my tires after applying Armor All and it all splattered up to the sides of my vehicle after driving away, I wrote these off as a simple mistake and that it probably would not happen again.
 
Today's experience was worse. I took my truck in for a wash and I told the guy I did not have time for a hand wax (upsell) I was then pressured into buying it in advance so I could come back another day and get it waxed. No was not an answer to this guy, I had to actually walk away to leave this Pressured UPSELL.
 
Again, I purchased the premium wash. They called for the vehicle and I noticed that there were little black spots (mud?) all over the side of the truck. I told the guy about this and he said ""its ready."" I explained that it wasnt and started using my finger to poke at what was probably 20-30 little black spots all over the side, he gave me a disgusted look and told me he had to go get a clean rag. I asked for a manager.
 
The manager came and had the guy wipe the spots off, but did not seem to care at all and walked away before the guy wiped down half of the spots. I had already given a tip to the first guy and this guy stood there expecting a tip, I am generous with tips, but will not tip more because I had to ask them to fix their mistake.
 
Upon entry of my vehicle I noticed there was still some dirt on the floor and my center console armrest was not cleaned. I only took the truck in due to my dog leaving paw prints on the center armrest and hair all over the place...

The service (management, staff etc) were extremely attentive and responsive to requests as well as keeping the place extremely well clean and cleared.

I love carbs...Carbs with carbs and a side of carbs.  They serve warm syrup with their pancakes (yum!) and their bread is just amazing.  

The ""side of pancakes"" is plenty big for a meal and they are always consistent, fluffy, and tasty.  

They offer both a dark roast and a house roast for coffee and all the powdery loveliness (cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa) to top it off just right.

I found the sangria a little on the acidic side, but drinkable, and it was fortified with something, because it was a lot stronger than it tasted.  My friend's mojito was good.

I LOVED the bruschetta. Not only were the toppings well-planned and delicious, but the bread had a nice crunch and a slightly smoky fire-baked taste to it. Ditto for the pizza, in which the crust shared the stage with the toppings.  Don't expect cheese-red sauce-and-pepperoni type pizzas, as you might expect from the look of the place, the pizza is artisianal.

Nearly half the seating is out on the patio, and one unusual feature is that the seats were low and the tables as well.  This makes it a good place to relax with your friends (as you feel like you're sitting on patio furniture) but harder to eat your food.

We had good service the night we went (a weeknight, around 8:30).  Zero wait for our table, and prompt, polite service.  I would definitely go here again.",2011-04-18

4655,2625,2207,"Chance encounter on this little (well, maybe not soo little) gem of a place. Yelped it the moment I passed by it because of all the cars present in their parking lot. Although there are only 8 reviews for the place, what people had to say about it really made me want to visit. 

Was well greeted on a spontaneous adventure to the restaurant for dinner. The bar was packed so my party decided to get seated in the main dining area. Got seated right away and was introduced to our server in no time. Think she had to swallow a chill pill or something because it took some time for her to be nice (most likely the main reason im not giving this place 5 stars)

The menu was pretty reasonable. Starters dont exceed $10 and entrees range anywhere from $5-$15 (If Im correct, there is only one item on the menu costing $15) 

We started off with three appetizers, thinking it would be the only dishes ordered (little did we know):

- Grilled Spicy Chicken Wings: Some a little burnt but it tasted great. The portions are large and seasoning just right (or too bland depending on what you prefer). I liked that it was grilled, less of that greasy hell overwhelming the taste of the actual meat.

- Homemade lemon garlic Hummus with pita : sooo delicious. It was only about $6, it comes with a bunch of pita. My party of 4 shared it and still had left overs =] definitely recommended.

- Cheeseburger Sliders x3 on Egg Bun: The bun is delicious! and the meat is perfectly cooked (medium) and seasoned. The perfect balance of meat, bun, and cheese. Comes with diced pickles.

We were having a jolly time when all of a sudden someone notices a dish being served to the the table next to us. It looked so good, she decided to order it herself. We ended up sharing the Half Chicken entree and I was extremely impressed with how it came out.

The chicken is juicy and tender the entire way through. No parts of the chicken dry, every bite was well savored and just...mmm mmm mm
Came with two sides (we chose the green beans/onions and mashed potatoes): green beans weren't my favorite, they were overcooked but the mashed potatoes. Perfectly cooked, tasted so fresh. They don't use a ton of butter or sour cream which was favorable to my taste buds. 

Would definitely come again

FYI: 
happy hour 3-6:30 pm. From what I could make out on the menu written in chalk: Half off appetizers and three 5.5 oz of draft beer for $5 (normally $6 for 3 - 5 oz beer sampler) oh and something about $5 wine",2010-12-30

I've mostly been here for Happy Hour when visiting AZ, but I've also stopped in a few late nights, and have always had a good time.

The Lodge has one of the best Happy Hours (deal wise) in Old Town. All apps (except the mac & cheese and fried pickles) are half off along w/$2 cheap drafts, $3 Lodge signature drafts (which is a tasty beer) & $3 wells (stuck to beer on this last trip, but if I recall in the past they actually use a heavy pour during happy hour).

I've tried quite a few of the apps, and they're all good. The pretzels & cheese are particularly tasty. I always get pretzels & cheese no matter where I am w/the friend I came here w/for happy hour the last time I was here so I can say I've tried quite a few in my day & the Lodge's ranks right up there!

3215,2052,1621,"Let's make it very clear that this is not a country club, but if you are a golfer like me and play ""slightly"" over par, this is a good course to play.

Here are the pro's:
-Cheap green fees (summertime, it is only 10 bucks for all you can play, I believe after 3 p.m..  I've shown up earlier than that and they still gave me the same price, with a cart.  Awesome)
-The staff is pretty cool
-You almost never need a tee time, you can show up and they will usually fit you in no problem
-No dress code (a huge plus while playing in the summer)
-A pretty forgiving course, wider fairways
-Cheap hotdogs in the snack area and they pump the AC pretty cold in the lounge
-No doglegs on the course (I fucking hate those)
-They don't seem to give a shit when you smuggle your own beer on the course
-No punk kid cleaning your clubs 2 seconds after you are done playing so you feel obligated to give him a tip

The Con's:
-A good portion of the grass is fucked up.  I've dinged the piss out of my clubs having to hit from the dirt on this course
-The greens are in bad shape.  You throw away a lot of shots putting from the ""mud"" or ""dirt""  I played there once where some asshole carved a pentagram in the green next to the cup.  It always makes me feel better knowing Satan is watching how shitty I am playing
-No bathroom on the course except for the port-o-shitter half way through the course.  It usually has so much urine on the floor and walls you are better off pissing in the bushes or out of the cart when you are driving it.  I was there one time where someone actually shit on the floor of the fiberglass shit house
-There seem to be a lot of homeless people between holes 7 and 8 asking for change and/or beers set up by the dumpster next to the golf course 
-There are a bunch of cats that run out of the brush in the wash.  I almost hit one with a chip shot the last time I played there. 

All things considered, this is a good course to play and have fun at.  Plus you can't beat the price.  Just don't expect Judge Smails at Bushwood Estates.",2010-07-25

I'd say this place gets less than 5 stars based on atmosphere. The place kind of feels like a cafeteria and the vibe from the entire patron situation is just bleh. The best part about the atmosphere was my own company and that of our server, Brandon, who was really helpful and chatty.

Also, while my roommate got the Chile Relleno, which was okay in my opinion, I had the Fuego Tacos with pernil (which apparently is pork), and they were delicious. I absolutely loved and devoured them. 

Some other key points: The drinks were very tasty and parking is very easy. We parked at a meter (which is free after 5p), and I'm told they can validate the parking ticket for the underground parking.

4652,1881,3468,"During my five-day stay in Tempe/Phoenix, I honestly did not have a single bad meal.  Every restaurant and coffee joint I stopped at gave me great experiences.  I wanted to end my trip out to Arizona with a good dinner, and I found myself at Dos Gringos to hopefully find that last meal out west.

Honestly, the name sold me pretty quickly.  Obviously, I'm not going to expect fine cuisine and classy dining at a place called Dos Gringos, but being a fan of dives and being one with my fellow man, it sounded like a good place to experience.

Despite it being chilly at night now this time of year, it was still an experience upon arrival.  It's like the tacky, somewhat tasteless, lampooned Mexican version of TGI Fridays, with a whole bunch of crap all over the walls, and a whole lot of hand-painted placards with sayings that make all of our inner-14-year-olds chuckle and appreciate.  The parking was free and plentiful, and I'm always a fan of the grungy, Christmas lights hanging all over the place kind of decor; my kind of style for relaxation and no-nonsense.

There were TVs everywhere, which was nice to watch some Sunday Night Football in the process, and I sat wherever I pleased.  Service was from a cute petite blond waitress who was quick to take my order, deliver my beer, and bring my food when it was ready.  I ordered an enchilada, and two ""street"" tacos, which were corn tortilla apparently.  Don't take my word for it, being an uneducated in Mexican food, east coaster, but I thought it was great.  Definitely different than the kind of ""Mexican"" food I can get in Atlanta.

Overall, I can't say that I had a bad experience.  The food was filling, not really expensive, and tasty to my tastebuds.  Beer, football on a mild evening in a place full of 56 pieces of tacky Mexican flair and a waitress with a great smile, and I can't complain.

Just strange names. We ordered and sat down. 35-40 minutes later, we realized the food still hadn't come and we'd never make it out to Scottsdale for our movie.

Kona Grill is a chain which makes me want to give them only 3 stars, but considering their food is quality, they offer a fun atmosphere, and their service is decent... I'm giving 4 stars instead.

As many of the reviews before mine say, happy hour at Kona is great.  From 3 - 7, they offer 1/2 off a small menu of appetizers, sushi rolls, pizzas, and drinks.  (They also have a reverse happy hour from 10pm on I think).  I can't speak for the pizzas (I've never tried them), but the potsticker appetizer is great, and so is the sushi.  If I'm not concerned about happy hour prices, I've often ordered other menu items such as seaweed salad, edamame, nigiri, and the seabass entree too.  I've never been disappointed.

I didn't realize that ALL the Embassy suites do the Manager's happy hour in the evenings; this one was 5:30 - 7:30...But let me back it up a bit. My whole experience here was wonderful.

A nice man, Terry, drove the shuttle from the airport and was very helpful giving me some ""things to do ideas"" around the area - movie theatre, shopping mall...etc. When we pulled up to the front he even pointed out a restaurant next door, 7-11 and CVS. I was super tired from my flight so it was nice that he took the time to point things out since I was not paying attention.

I went inside and checked in- very fast and smooth. The FD clerk even offered me a beverage- hot coffee/tea/cocoa.  She even told me how to access the internet free of charge.  I found my room quite quick and going inside was so refreshing!

I had an immense amount of space for just me, as these acommodations are suites. The little kitchenette was stocked with tea and coffee and ice machine was just around the corner, not too far of a walk.  It was extremely chilly in the room so after I found the thermostat, I turned it to be warmer- I ended up turning it off I was so cold.  I did a quick flip through of TV channels but didn't find anything I wanted to watch. And then I tried to connect to internet- fast and easy.  I called to see about getting a bathrobe and some toothpaste and it was brought up in less than 10 minutes!

I thought about going sightseeing and ended up taking a nap. I didn't realize how tired I was!  The bed was great! Comfy and warm!  I didn't want to get up!  But I ended up getting up so I could go to CVS across the street for a few needed items.

Next morning when I left, there was nothing I needed to do to check out and the shuttle service back to the airport was very prompt. 

I wouldn't mind staying here again should I be stopping through town or stuck overnight on an unforseen layover!

4060,1749,3090,"Went there for lunch.  Split a chopped salad and a deviled eggs.

Large portions.  Salad was a bit heavy on sauce, but I liked it.  Deviled eggs had some truffle oil which made them pretty good.  

Burger was gigantic.  Ordered onion rings that were just not good at all... must be frozen pre-bought, which sucks.  Burger kind of tasted oily bland.  Tried to add mustard, and it wasn't terrible, but for an upscale burger at $12 expected just a bit better.  Companion had sweet potato fries which were much better.

Service even though the place was dead was very slow.  Not unfriendly, but they need to realize people that go for a mid-week lunch usually don't have 1.5-2 hours to eat.

All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience.  I really like the ambience... love the modern look of brick and blackened steel.  

But I'd probably be more interested in coming here for beers and drinks with a couple appetizers, than a sit-down meal.  For a meal, there are just much better central Phoenix locations.",2011-07-07

9425,2136,5355,"Until they get their quality under control, we won't eat here except for lunch. We ate here last weekend and both had the roasted chicken. The problem was it tasted like it was basted in cinnamon and the sauce for the risotto had at least 10 whole peppercorns on each of our plates. I actually bit into to one before I realized that the sauce was just crawling with them. They could've strained them out, processed them in, whatever, just don't serve me a plate with a bunch of whole peppercorns. This tasted NOTHING like the previous visit when I ordered the same exact dish. When we finally let the management know that our food was unacceptable, he said the best he could do was a 20% discount. Well. we  weren't looking for a free or discounted meal, but rather some acknowledgement that they actually cared about the food. That never happened. Unless something changes, the burgers are decent and that is about it.",2012-07-10

1630,1222,1388,"I had never heard of this place until some friends from out of town brought us a bottle of the olive oil. So when I had out of town company visiting, we made a trip to the Olive Mill and signed up for the tour. 

The tour is not really much of a tour, but more of a 20-25 minute lesson on growing and harvesting olives, and then a look at the equipment used to press the oil. Our tour guide was very entertaining and funny. While there was a long period of standing, there is very little walking so really anyone can get their $5 worth.

While waiting for the tour to start, we wandered around the store and then enjoyed the wine and cider tasting outside. They also have live music every Saturday. 

After the tour we filled several sample cups with a variety of olive oil flavors, and bought a loaf of bread, and enjoyed figuring out what was in each cup. The line to order food was too long, so we didn't stick around for a meal, but everything looked wonderful. 

The only less than positive thing I have to say is that they really promoted the Pork Shop down the road, so we went there hoping to load up on ready made food (since we had opted not to wait in line for Olive Mill food). It's actually a butcher shop that also sells a few cooked items. There were BBQ pork burritos, green chili burritos, and spare ribs. The pork burrito was alright, but the sauce overwhelmed the meat so that's all you could really taste. 

The ribs were really a disappointment. They are around $6-7 a pound, and although they were meaty, it took way too much work to get the meat off of the bones. Perhaps a few more hours in the oven, and they would have been better - but I don't recommend going out of your way to check this place out.",2012-04-10

The food was burnt  on one side and raw on the other. The manager was too busy flirting with the other help. We couldn't get drinks because all the glasses where dirty, we were told by our waitress.

9008,290,3484,"Okay, so a group of us go out practically every Friday to the same old places for beer and food, but mostly for beer. So to break out of the norm, I was in search of a place with excellent beer and good food and somewhat close to home. So onto Yelp I go and came upon Boulders, and the reviews were pretty good and definitely worth checking out. So we all pack into the car and head over to Boulders. The parking is great, plenty of spaces to go around. You walk through the patio, not bad with all the misters, felt like I was in a rainforest, but very refreshing. So you walk a little further, watch the steps, and there's your bar. Very open, plenty of hightop tables and lots of TV's. The beer menu was plentiful. It should make everyone from the microbrewer to the coors drinker happy. I was pleased because they had plenty of vegetarian meals, or dishes you can substitute meat for veggies... and for you meat eaters out there, I was told the burgers were delicious and the waffle fries were soooo tasty. The staff was helpful and attentive as well. I would definitely add this into our Friday night rotation. If you're looking for microbrews, this is a place to check out.

So basically all they had to do is toast my bagel, and slice the onion and tomato and then just plate.  Nothing revolutionary here.  So this is why I cant really give Tryst a fair assessment.

As luck would have it there was no left turn onto Dobson and we ended up going East on the 202 the opposite direction of the Dairy Queen.  So I searched again and we came up with Yogurtland.  It wasn't luck after all but some ice cream higher power at work to bring us to our frozen yogurt oasis in Yogurtland.  Not only were the ingredients fresh and delicious but the price was reasonable as well. 5 of us each had a scrumptious & generously portioned sundae and our total bill was less than $20!

Recently my fiancé and I went to Lolo's. I had heard about Lolo's and Mrs. White's for years, but never took the time to go to the Phoenix locations. When this south Scottsdale location opened, I made it a point to go and try the food. 

The food is excellent or in my best Brooklyn accent ""Forget about it"". But don't forget about it, the MAC-N-CHEESE is a most try. The chicken is FANTABULOUS, the COLLARD GREENS are on point and they serve Kool Aid. Yes I said Kool Aid. I must have had a gallon of GRAPE KOOL AID. Before this, the last time I had Kool Aid was 1968. 

This place is very popular, so you may have to wait for a table, but it is well worth it. This place is so popular that Sports, Music, Acting and Reality celebrities can be seen here regularly. When we were there we saw the rapper Biz Markie. He did the song ""Just a Friend"" back in 1990.  

The only down side - although the service was generally good, it gets so busy that at times the server may get distracted and may not come back to you as timely or often as you may like.

And man! So surprised! I thought we'd be staying in a very outdated motel room. I mean let's face it, most motels that claim ""newly remodeled"" usually just put in a new tv. But when we opened the door we found new furniture, a very plush bed, new lighting, flat screen tv and a rather large and new ""mini"" fridge. It was really nice - compared to other Best Western's I've visited. 

The train is right behind the hotel, but to be honest, the A/C was cranking the entire time we were there (Arizona in June) so we could hardly hear it.

Their food is absolutely delcious and is on par with a high end chinese restaurant.  The quality of the meat, fish and vegetables is just excellent and it's always very consistent.

I had the Chicken Caprese sandwich which was quite tasty, but the burger my mom has was WAY better.  If you go here.... order a burger.  They are big, juicy and super duper good.  It's also super duper messy.  It's a ""fork and knife"" type of burger. 

Their bloody mary is pretty good... a little too tomato-y.... needed more seasoning.

Mom's John Daly Peach drink was refreshing.  Good for cooling off and relaxing after a round of golf.  :)

Tater Tots were served with our sandwiches and they were good... but nothing all that special.  They were crunchy on the outside and soft and hot on the inside... but for this type of establishment.... I would have expectetd Truffle Tots or something different.

Their relishes that they offered on the side were 'ok'..... I was not impressed.  They tasted like they were from a bottle.... I'm sure they make their own relish... I'm just saying they didn't taste any different than the ones you get at the store.",2011-11-13

7137,2200,4937,"Its refreshing to find one-of-a-kind places -- God knows Phoenix needs more of them to inject personality into this generic, strip-mall, chains-on-every-corner valley. Finding this unique sandwich shop, which is in a house that has been transformed into a restaurant, is indeed a welcome find. The real estate is limited, so parking is compact and circles around the back of the building.

The dining area is mainly indoors, but there is also a small patio facing the back portion of the parking lot, which is not very scenic. Inside there is art on the wall that can be purchased.

They serve wraps, bowls and salads. The food has been pretty good, although it did not knock my socks off. I ordered the Baja Bowl, which is described on their online menu as ""Southwestern chicken atop garlic rice, black beans, Monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pico de gallo."" It was OK, but the chicken was dry and cut in fairly large chunks. It could have possibly been microwaved -- not sure, but there were no southwest flavors to speak of. I have done a better job of cooking chicken on my George Foreman grill at home. Perhaps the garlic rice would have helped with the flavor, but I had substituted the rice with organic brown rice which did little to add flavor. Sour cream was not ""lime"". There was a small slice of lime served on the edge of the bowl. I would not bother ordering this again -- especially if I have a craving for some southwest food.

On another recent visit I ordered a wrap called ""Prince of Thai's - Spicy peanut chicken with baby spinach, garlic rice, fresh ginger slaw, cucumber pico and red onion wrapped in a spinach tortilla."" That had better flavor than the baja bowl. Vegetable ingredients were fresh and good. Again, I was not very impressed with the chicken chunks.

One thing I think That's A Wrap needs to address is the use of styrafoam cups. Afterall their slogan is ""Healthy Food for a Hungry Planet"" and they have a link for a new restaurant ""Green"" for Vegan food on their website. For such an artsy, earthy place, I would have thought That's A Wrap would have made more conscious, earth-friendly choices. For that reason and the bland chicken, I give them an average rating only.",2009-03-08
8557,6,1790,"Had a fabulous time here with my husband celebrating my birthday last weekend. We both got ""The Farmer's Feast"" and it was truly amazing. I was not expecting that we would each get unique dishes so that let us sample even more of the food (though the hubby didn't really share too much). I highly recommend this option for anyone dining here. 

The antipasti was a great selection of cured meats and local cheeses. Next, I had a wonderful salad that was a great combination of sharp peppery flavors mixed with sweet. Strawberries, arugula, radishes, yum! For pasta course I got gnocchi with a rich and tasty cream sauce and my husband got ravioli stuffed with yam. His dish was amazing, I had to fight for a couple bites. For the fish course I had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious. The hubby got a very lightly seared tuna fillet. I was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy. For our main course I got a pork tenderloin and the hubby got braised beef... just lucky we each got our favorite meats. Each came with other vegetables and starches on the plate so they would have been an ample meal in and of themselves. For dessert, I got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing. One of the best deserts I have ever eaten. Very rich but the pieces were small enough so that it was not heavy. The dessert did not have too much sweetness so it went well with the ice wine it was served with which tasted like pure honey. Just fantastic. The hubby got bread pudding which we didn't much care for and it came with a sorbet that I didn't try. I got the wine pairings with the meal and every wine just complimented the dish it was served with so beautifully that I was really glad I added that option. Also, it ended up that you got a half glass (at least) with each course so I think it is a good value (the wine pairing was an extra $45.) 

I do agree with a couple of the reviewers who mentioned salt. There were a couple of dishes that had just a tad too much. However, I think that was not due to a mistake of the chef, I believe it is just because they use cured meats in a lot of their dishes. Another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all. Our server was extremely warm and friendly. She was very knowledgeable on the food and could answer any questions we had for her. She also took the time for each course to explain each dish and in my case the wine and why they went together. Only one time did my wine not come out at the same time with the food course and in that case our server apologized immediately. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow... however, I believe that this is intentional. They have created a very cozy and comfortable environment and they want you to linger and enjoy yourself. With the Farmer's Feast in particular it took us almost 3 hours start to finish but I enjoyed every minute of it. It was nice to have time in between courses to sit and talk and relax. The spacing also kept us from feeling too full by the end (it is six courses after all!) or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next. I was able to enjoy each course separately and independently with its own unique wine. It was pure food heaven. This is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event; when you come here, this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough!  We truly had fantastic night here.

One warning I will say is for ladies, you need to be prepared for the rural atmosphere and the walk from the car to the restaurant would be challenging in heels (I had been warned so had wedges). In fact the dress code overall was a bit more casual than I was expecting. Kai at Wildhorse Pass resort is my absolute favorite ""special occasion"" restaurant and so we were making a lot of comparisons between the two. My husband made the comment that when we were at Kai we spoke in library whispers the whole time and felt a little awkward at times (you know the type of place where you feel like if you use the wrong fork you may end up getting kicked out) but at Quiessence we were chatting away the whole time and completely at ease. It is definitely a much more comfortable and relaxed environment then any other I have experienced at a restaurant of this caliber.",2011-04-25

My omelet was stuffed to the max with bacon and oozing melty cheese.  It wasn't a big fluffy omelet like at IHOP but it was a dense solid little guy.  I much prefer my omelets to be like this.  The husband was a little less than pleased with his meal.  We both agreed the gravy was pretty good and we really liked that there was actually sausage in it, the way it should be.  The disappointment was definitely in the biscuits though.  They were certainly not fresh and definitely not homemade.  Considering how easy and quick biscuits are to make, this bummed me out.  To the owner of Turf:  If you want me to, I will be more than happy to come over and show you how to make a good biscuit.  If there are good, fresh biscuits, this could be a great dish.

5058,2193,3718,"I'm a supporter of this store. At present, it leaves something to be desired, but we're starved for a place to shop on this side of town that has local and/or natural foods, so something is better than nothing! Also, I have faith that they will expand the available goods as time goes on. I'm excited to see how it develops.

The good:  Great bread! This is the best part of this place thus far. The breads are fresh daily, baked locally, CHEAP ($1.79 per loaf for white, wheat, rye, marble ryle, onion, etc...), and all natural. And most importantly, they taste really good.  Picking up a loaf of the onion rye has already become a weekly ritual for me. They also have specialty pastries, tortillas, etc. Though I haven't tried those yet, they look good, and the prices are also very reasonable.

The produce is also good. It's not a huge selection, but the prices are fair and the quality seems good. It's great to have locally grown items available nearby.

Everyone who works there is super friendly, which is great, and they seem to be open long hours, which is really convenient.

The down-side: As I said, very limited selection. The dry goods vary between local (mostly) and mass-produced (some random items). Some of the local artisan products look great, but they're very expensive. I think they'd be a little cheaper at an actual farmers' market (ie, where we're buying direct from the producer)--but I do plan to save up so I can try the pasta, etc.

Weirdly, this place rounds out its selection of local/natural stuff with mass-produced crappy candy, ice cream bars, toilet paper, etc. I can't help but wish they'd found some greener alternatives. (Also-- Fiji Water? Come on, guys... That company is TERRIBLE. And the opposite of local. I don't get why they carry it.)

The dish comes on a nice square plate so it makes the food 50x fancier just because it's on a square plate. Lots of shrimp in my plate ~ about 10ish and they're large. The shrimp was grilled and it tasted good but I wouldn't call it amazingly good that I was in love. I ate it and I like it but I thought to myself 'What is Cambodian food because the flavors don't seem unique? It seems like they grilled it in some soy sauce, maybe sugar, added more salt and maybe one or two other spices."" FYI - There's bunch of green onions in the shrimp, I think they add that more flavor. They aren't chopped into small pieces, it's like the whole stem but I ate everything. I always eat everything - I don't waste my food (it's almost like a sin not to finish your food unless you take it home... so nevermind).

The pickled salad was refreshing. I like the soup, it was lukewarm and it reminded me of a Chinese wintermelon homecooked soup. It's like a mixed of Chinese style chicken broth with Vietnamese beef broth without the saltiness and msg. Adding the green onions to the soup definitely makes it 50x better as well - WOOHOO. 

My dish was $8 - pretty good price. Thumbs up to that!

Overall, would I go back? Eh - I don't know. I need to try other Cambodian places or maybe I should just have googled about it...maybe Vietnamese food is better? Apparently, the countries are located near each other so it's similar to Vietnamese food.",2012-08-07
1175,933,1039,"My first visit to Picazzo's is not what I had hoped it would be at all.  A few of my friends who have fine taste in food raved about it and so I had high hopes.  Let me start by saying, I'm not really a gourmet pizza lover.  As a teacher, I have plenty of Domino's and Pizza Hut all the time, and can be quite happy with that, either that or I love a great slice of New York style pie.  

Since I am not a huge fan of gourmet pizza and the overabundance of toppings, I checked the menu for a nice plate of delicious pasta.  I was incredibly unhappy to find that they had about 6 pastas and they all sounded bland and/or too strange to order.  Then, I found their sandwich section.  I decided on their Spicy Chicken sandwich that sounded perfect.  But it took awhile for our waitress to come over, so I glanced at the pizzas and found a couple that sounded good too.  Thank goodness I did, because as I ordered the sandwich, the waitress informed me that they only serve the sandwiches at lunchtime!  What?!  That really peeved me off.  What is irritating is on the menu there is a clear line between the section that says ""Lunch Specials"" and where it says ""Sandwiches.""  I mean, there is an actual black line drawn between the two...to me, that says that they aren't a part of lunch.  Don't you think?  

Instead I ordered the Popeye and Olive Oyl pizza, which has a white garlic sauce, spinach, artichoke hearts, garlic, Kalamata olives, carmelized onions, mozarella, Roma tomatoes, and Applewood smoked bacon.  After I ordered it, I really thought how I truly didn't even want it.  I was really irritated.  

My husband and I both ordered our own pizza since we couldn't agree on what we wanted, so he got The Vortex, which basically had all the meats you could possibly think of.  For an appetizer we ordered the garlic cheese bread, which was way too garlicy.  It came with olive oil for dipping...I would have preferred some marinara sauce or something.  After I had ate the bread, I really didn't want my pizza b/c of knowing that it had so much garlic.  I picked a lot of the garlic cloves off along with most of the other toppings...there was just too much on it.  I know for some, they would probably like that...but it just isn't my thing to have too much on my pizza.  

All in all, the pizza was pretty good, once I picked off half of the toppings.  The crust was really tasty and had the perfect crispiness and softness to it.  I could have had just had that alone and been happy at that point.  

My husband and I both agreed that it won't be a place we go to again, unless it is for lunch time, so I can try the sandwich my mouth had actually been watering for.",2009-07-11
3316,48,2596,"I've been meaning to try this place for months and I'm so glad that the temperature has finally dropped to less than 100 degrees so I could take advantage of the outdoor patio for lunch!

I didn't experience the 50's personally, but this place has really kept and captured that essence.  (And yes, it's been renovated.  This place was built in the 50's but it's not run down or anything like that.)

There were also too many people, so crowding and navigation were problematic. There were a good number of tents offering free samples. It was great to try food from several local places, since we got to discover new places to visit later. Unfortunately, none were selling food, so we couldn't also get lunch on the spot and had to go elsewhere for a full meal. I like this event as a way to try food samples and explore potential places to visit in the future.",2011-11-12
1846,137,19,"I always feel a sense of guilt having to write a less than stellar review after meeting the owner of a restaurant. 

Lucia was Beautiful and sweet, and a pleasure to meet, my lunch, however, was not fit to eat. 

I ordered the THE HUMM-DINGER VEGAN WRAP: Roasted artichoke, zucchini, red bell pepper, onion, fresh spinach and hummus with a balsamic reduction drizzle, with a side of fruit and the sun dried tomato wrap. 

Notice it says ""Roasted"", the cashier told me the Veggies were ""Grilled"". Unfortunately, to my dismay, they were neither. 

Everything inside was heated up, by either stove or microwave, I'd guess the latter, and the ""Sun Dried Tomato Wrap"" was thin, doughy and utterly flavorless, not to mention a shocking pink color, which I'm sure was due to being naturally colored with beet juice, but did not help make things anymore appetizing. The fruit was a soggy pile of your typical pre-cut cantaloupe, honey dew mix. 

It was not what I was expecting AT ALL, when I think of a grilled veggie wrap, I imagine tasting all those veggies bursting with flavor after caramelizing on the grill, they had no flavor though. I also did not expect the temperature to be Hot, chilled would have been better in my opinion if the veggies had actually bee grilled that is. 

This lunch to me was less than average and as I sat there will my full plate in front of me I was asked how my meal was, I clearly stated my concerns as I have here and was simply told that it was a ""Best Seller"". 

Lucia did send over a piece of chocolate cake, which was appreciated, but unfortunately missed the mark since I'm Vegan and the desserts aren't. 

Honestly, in my opinion, aside from the market, most of the menu items are anything but healthy. 

The 3 stars is for the market, my food would have been 1.

And that folks is why I am the Lunch Snob!",2011-05-05

8209,193,5505,"Decided on a whim at the last minute to go here for dinner tonight, I guess that's not the thing to do here.  Worked out perfect though, arrived at just about 4pm to see a hand full of people waiting and the the restaurant didn't open till 5pm.  After a short debate we decided to stay, it helped that there was ample shade.  The wait while hot was not uncomfortable and for the most part, newbies and veterans honored each others arrival order.  40 seats is not much for a place that does this much business and it was surprising to learn that most waiting were from out of town.  I also learned that reservations are accepted on line for parties of 6 to 10 and only 3 reservations per night.  Reservations are usually 1 1/2 to 2 months out.  Luckily for us there was only one reserved table for 10 ahead of everyone.  5 o'clock rolled around and the loading procedure ran smooth as clock work and we had drink and food orders in by quarter after.  Service was excellent and fast with just the right amount of time between salad and main course.  I could not have asked for much more from my food, maybe a bit more basil on my mozzarella and tomato salad, everything was amazing including my Mexican coke.  We ordered 2 pizzas, both wood fire baked to perfection.  I could have eaten a whole loaf of the bread that comes with the salads, or for $2 on its own.  None of our food was greasy or soggy, the olive oil they use is excellent and the fresh mozzarella mouth watering.  I will go back again, planning on getting there an hour before opening.  Although the food is amazing and well worth an hours wait in the Phoenix sun and heat, I would not wait for 4 to 6 hours as some people do.  So for me this was a win and a lucky last minute dinner decision.",2010-07-03

Their homemade root beer and limeade are also yummy. I remember them having a customer appreciation day once a year (I think in May) where lunch and dinner and free! You would get a pulled pork sandwich, a side and a drink for nothing. The lines would be out the door, but the food is worth the wait.

9309,4013,5683,"I always have customer service problems with Fedex.  How the heck did they get to be so big with the crappy way they treat customers?  I use the Internet a lot for purchases and about 60% of the time, they screwed-up and then their customer service has major difficulty fixing the problems.  I have asked for shipments to be held at the closet shipping location to my office and they ship to my home.  Another time I asked for the same thing and they held it at the regional depot instead of where I asked that it be sent.  I can go on and on about the screw-ups I have experienced with Fedex.  

But this time they really pissed me off.  I get a harassing phone calls from a collection agency that says they have been contracted by Fedex to collect an overdue bill from me in the amount of $4000+.  I have asked them for details and all I get is harassment.  So I asked Fedex for help and customer service told me to contact Fedex Revenue Services, which I did.  I told them that I am getting harassing phone calls from XYZ collection agency and the person who keeps calling is named Chris.  I also tell them that the alleged amount owed is $4000+ and the account is supposedly in my name.  So I ask that they investigate and tell me if I indeed have an overdue account in my name for this amount.  (I know I do not have such an account!).  Fedex then tells me that they cannot help me because I have not provided enough information.  WTF?  How much more information can I provide?  Do they want my height and weight?  Maybe my blood type?  Maybe I have to provide the names and birth dates of my children too?

I expected a smaller place but I was pleasantly suprised when I pulled up to a medium sized store.  I was greated with a smile and asked what I would like.  It was a Sunday afternoon so they were not very busy.  I liked the fact that you tell them what you want and they toss it on the grill right in front of you.  Everything is freshly cooked.  They did the same with the onion rings and french fries too.  Everything was fresh and hot.  My daughter had her favorite....a hot dog, which she loved, and fries which were fresh and crisp.  I had a burger and onion rings.  Yes, the onion rings were delicious!  The batter was great and the onions were a little on the sweet side.  My burger was cooked to perfection.

1775,1082,1503,"Known as ""The Jewel of the Desert"" and the ""Grand Dame,"" this beautiful hotel is the only one in the world with a Frank Lloyd Wright-influenced design.  The architect was a man named Albert Chase McArthur, who had studied under Frank Lloyd Wright.  Hence, the main restaurant's name is ""Frank and Albert's.""

Celebrating its 80th birthday this year, this unique art-deco resort is rich in history.  Dozens of presidents have golfed here, Marilyn Monroe splashed around in one of the 8 on-site pools, and many more celebrities and industry magnates have called this their temporary home.

When visiting here, it is important to note that on-site parking is costly.  A self parking fee of $12 is imposed even on its guests, and the self parking lot is often located some distance from the hotel entrance.  For those not wanting to bother with parking the car themselves, the price is$27 to valet.  The package I purchased luckily had the self-parking included, but the car was delivered to the valet nonetheless.  I was sure to speak to a hotel manager about how ridiculous it is to ask a hotel guest to pay for parking, and he happily credited our room for the valet fee.

So, my first experience was our dinner at ""Frank and Albert's"", formerly known as the ""Biltmore Grill.""  Local purveyors provide the ingredients for nearly all of its organic dishes.  From Queen Creek Olive Oil to Shriner's Sausage, Mesa Ranch Goat Cheese to Biltmore grown Rosemary, one can taste the difference.  The menu provided a range of selections from salads, pizzas, and flatbreads, to rotisserie and classic comfort foods.  The wood stone baked filet of salmon was flavorful, tender, and full of tender feelings. I recommend their ""bloody rose"" cocktail.  I snicker as I write these words, because bloody marys are my least favorite cocktail.  However, this unique blend is made with crop organic tomato vodka and juice, fresh biltmore grown rosemary and spices.  Service was attentive and timely, waiter was very knowledgeable, and we were very impressed with the quality and flavor of the food.  

Next, it was on to the newly added wing of the resort, the Ocatilla.  The Ocatilla is essentially a new boutique hotel situated on the Biltmore property.  It has its own pool, a concierge, and an executive lounge which offers daily complimentary breakfasts, a light evening fare, beer and wine, desserts, as well as coffee and soft drinks.Our package included a room on the third floor of this location, as well as access to its executive lounge.  

Although our stomachs were full from dinner, we made room for chocolate covered cheesecake, choc. covered strawberries, fudge brownies, tarts, and chocolate chunk cookies.  We swallowed it all down with some prosecco, and headed up to our room.

The room was at least 500sq feet, and I believe that the rest of the hote has fairly sizeable rooms, as well.  The decor was a blend of art deco and southwestern.  The bathroom with its granite countertops, boasted a tub with sea salts and candle, in which we submerged ourselves comfortably up to our chins.  Two plush robes were there for us to lounge around in.  A snack bar was provided, although a package of nuts and dried fruit was $7.  Biggest disappointment was that that there was no wetbar.  I always look forward to these in any hotel room, especially to use them for storing leftovers from dinner.  The king bed was etremely comfortable, with its pillow-top mattress and feather pillows, as well as the high thread count sheets.  Silky soft...

We enjoyed peace and quiet all night, and were not disturbed in the morning by housekeeping.

The next day were were early to rise to enjoy the lavish continental breakfast spread in the lounge.  Granola with local pecans and yogurt parfait croissans with spinach and boursin, ham and cheese, small danishes, assortmnt of fresh fruits and juices gave us the perfect start to our day.  We grabbed some bottled waters and cokes and headed to the pool.  We had an appointment at the spa an hour later, for seaweed wraps and massages, and it was wonderful, the service excellent and very personalized.

Recommendations:
go to biltmore's website directly to book a room. you will find incredible packages. our package was $200 and included dinner for two, lunch for two, 50% off at the spa, and access to the executive lounge at the ocatilla.

if you live locally, they will shuttle you - saves the parking headache.

About Ocatilla:
basically an upgrade with your stay. For an additional $75-$100/day, these are the following amenities you will receive:
complimentary beverages, wine, beer, breakfast, light evening fare, and desserts in the lounge
business center (computers, internet, printers)
Wii rentals

521,457,483,"Sheraton Desert Oasis is a great value in the late spring/early summer to get away for a few days and relax. 

It is part of the Starwood Hotel Chain, but this is one of their first forays in to the recent boom in Hotel chains opening time share residences for sale under their brands. So this was meant to be property that was sold in timeshares, which some have. mostly for winter weeks for cold snow birds.

But in the low season, which is summer, you can get a room for around $100. And what do you get? You get a nicely appointed, decorated model home, about a 700 square foot 1 bedroom apartment. It is repleat with 2 gas fireplaces, full kitchen with all wares and utensils, living room, patio with table and chairs, his/her bathroom sinks, a marbled tiled shower, a king size bed and a heart shaped large jacuzzi bathtub in the bedroom. 

It has a full social and activities calender, so it is a good place to take the kids. There is a large clover shaped pool, with multiple water fountains, and a large rocklike island structure with caves where the jacuzzi is located. There are about 75 chaise lounges and several tables, so there is usually one available for you. There is also a poolside grill for food and beverages. 

You are not far from the restaurants and nightlife of North Scottsdale, near Kierland Commons Mall, Desert Ridge Mall, 101 Mall, and about 6 other strip and big box shopping centers. You can buy food and easily eat in to save some money. The famed Tournament Players Club (TPC) gold course is close by, as well as the more exclusive and expensive Fairmont Princess hotel. 

This is more of a vacation home than an exclusive resort with people waiting on you hand and foot. But it is well maintained, nicely appointed, and a relaxing getaway. Peak season (winter) rates are $325 and up, so if you come in early summer, you get a bargain and a tan by the pool.",2008-06-14

8836,3339,2359,"I was reluctant to try this shop at first.  Some of the reviews that popped up via Google lead me to believe it unpleasant and not well-stocked.  Well, you can fool some of the people some of the time, and today, I was no longer fooled by whatever weird people out there have it in for Double Joy Beads.

Firstly, their Czech seed beads are the cheapest in town.  I'm not even kidding.  I purchased six half tubes and one full for around $10.  The organization thereof leaves something to be desired, but at those prices, browsing should be a joy.  

Their pressed glass and fire polished selections were of average number and price.  

In the Swavorski department, standard bicones, cubes and rounds are not available as singles- only some of the pendant materials, and even then, some come packed two to a bag.  I was a bit vexed by this.  What if someone wants one Baroque for a pendant?

The back sported a nice assortment of findings and stringing materials.  Particularly impressive: a display of natural copper items ready for raiding.  Sales bins occupied the front- some bags currently up for less than a quarter.  

I found the clerk on duty during my visit was more of the hands-off type, but quite personable when I checked out.

3343,2104,2616,"HELLLLLLLLO GOLFERS!   What a sexy course this is.   This ranks up there with some of the best courses I've ever played, and THE BEST desert course I have ever played!    Yes it's desert links style golf, but you're in the desert so what do you expect?  It's kind of a trek, but it'll be worth it.   From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you'll enjoy the service and scenery.  A real private club feel.

As mentioned earlier this is DESERT LINKS GOLF!   No adjoining fairways, and all the crap plays as PGA desert (lateral).   The fairways are pretty wide for the most part, so you can spray the ball a bit, but there is definitely some carry involved on some of the tee boxes.  Hole 18 is a very hard core par 4.   Long carry on the approach to the green with a TON of water along the right side of the fairway and green.   This is the kind of hole that can ruin a good day on the course real quick.   Don't be afraid to lay up.  :)    Oh, and there are mens ratings for ALL the tee boxes, I'd recommend higher handicappers play from the forward tees, because this course could be really hard if you're a mediocre golfer... 

Maintenance was perfect, even in September after baking in the Arizona heat all summer.   The fairways were well manicured, and not too hard.  Nice rough, but not too tall.   A slightly errant shot will be caught, but you won't have to worry about searching for your ball for 5 minutes either.   The greens were also perfect.   Nice and fast, and TRUE!

2908,71,208,"The Good Egg is a breakfast spot I frequent on a regular basis. During the week it's hopping with folks on their lunch breaks and the weekend crowd seems to be most predominant during brunch hours.

The menu offers a wide variety of items to choose from. They are only open for breakfast and lunch, but you can order any of them at any time during business hours. Pancakes of a mammoth proportion are often seen zooming by on the arm of a server. Instead of hashbrowns, homestyle fried potatoes are served on the side of most dishes.

The serving staff have always been very friendly and accommodating and it makes the experience a very pleasant one every time I am there. The patio is very large and can seat many. This is especially nice during sunny days, but not so much on a cold January morning even with the large heaters operating.

If you go on a weekend morning, prepare for a bit of a wait. You can sip complimentary coffee outside while waiting for your party to be called. It's always fun to give a fake name for your party as it is eventually announced over a very loud loudspeaker for the world to hear.

7036,3398,4875,"Totally excited to try this place out, my grandparents, my mom and I (4 of us) came here for some Korean food. It wasn't too busy; just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out. 

Unlike other Korean restaurants, their lunch special selection is very limited. Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda, special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda), or special C, Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken. 

As we were looking at the ""lunch special"" board, the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead. Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom ""are you Chinese?"" Even though she is, my mum looked at me all puzzled as in ""what does that mean?"" The lady proceeded by pointing at the ""seafood pancake"" section on the menu and saying ""I don't know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot."" Good thing my mom didn't hear what she said.. or else... 

So we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($6.99), a bulgogi ($6.99), and a beef yakisoba ($7.19). The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini ""kimchi"" buffet bar, with trays of marinated tofu, potato, bean sprout, kimchi, broccoli and some other vegetables. It also has this delicious house special hot sauce. 

By the time we finished a dish of kimchi, the food came, so it didn't take long. The spicy chicken, came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper), was tender, with rice underneath it. The chicken was definitely marinated well; however, the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat... what a bad way to end it. The bulgogi also came in a bowl, with rice underneath. The beef was definitely not marinated fully. The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless. The biggest disappointment, food-wise, was the beef yakisoba. The noodles, occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box, were sweet. Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice, topped with 3 pieces, I kid you not, THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized, super-dry meat. 

In the end, we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well, teenage boys tend to eat everything...). While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless), I went to ask for a plastic cover. This is the best part: the same lady, stared at me, pointed at the salad bar and said ""you can't take that home"". I thought there was a miscommunication, so I asked again for a lid for the noodles. Again, she pointed at the salad bar and said ""you are not allowed to take the kimchi home"". Wow seriously? Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out? ""Look, I just want to take my noodles home, ok?"" She hesitantly gave me a lid.

For those of you who avoid beets, I think you'll change your mind w/ this salad. The beets are sweet like candy.  Served w/ feta, mandarin oranges, candied pecans and a very unique pear dressing, you forget you're eating healthy. I've been trying to harvest the pear vinaigrette recipe forever!!!

The food here was delicious, I'd eat here regularly if I lived in Phoenix! When we arrived, we were worried about the hours since we got there pretty close to closing time, but they were cool! We shared the samosas and buffalo wings for appetizers. I ordered the Thai Peanut bowl with mock chicken and noodles for my entree. I felt like everything was flavored well and while I enjoy meat normally, this opened my mind to trying other vegetarian places in the future. I liked the ambiance here, great place to grab a bite with friends and chill. It was the perfect place to stop by after a busy weekend! I'll be back next time I'm in the area.",2010-08-28

I asked for my burger medium and it came well done, I am glad I didnt wait for her to come back and ask how my food was cause it was 1/2 hour before she came back. I was parched for some water.

Normally I order my food to go at the bar and just take it home and eat it. But the for the last 6 months when I go in to order my food at the bar, its always the same bar tender working and she is rude. The last 3 times I have been into order food I ended up just walking out and not ordering anything. She is always taking to what seems to be her friends at the bar. I always know what I want right when I go in, so there is no need for a menu, she greets me and hands me a menu totally ignoring me telling her that I already knew what I wanted. Then she precedes to talk to her ""friend"" or whoever at the bar for 15 minutes before taking my order. I know all of her personal business and even what she plans on wearing to her friends wedding in a few weeks. The food is good, but considering there are so many other really great sushi places with so much better customer services i would not recommend this place at all. Now I totally understand if this happens once in a while, but it has happened every time I have gone in there for the past 6 months.

The only downsides were the dim lighting and not enough wastebaskets or tissue boxes. But for the peace and quiet, I'll take that trade-off anyday!!

And my skillet I must have ordered the wrong thing because I usually just get the skillet with carnitas eggs and potatoes this time their was chorizo in it so it made my potatoes soggy:(  those things are another reason for dropped stars and also because I dont care for Chorizo and all its oils.

One of them remarked later that it was the only time in his life he'd spit food out in disgust. While this was happening, another friend and I asked a toothless Vietnam veteran manning another tent where we could find the nearest restroom.

Here's the problem(s) I have with the venue or CONS so to speak.

1. Cash Only almost EVERYWHERE, for a stadium named after a bank, don't you think someone would have taken finacial practice into better concern, perhaps CHASE just wants to sucker you more by making you pay their ATM fees if your not a member which I see as ""Greedy Fat Cat"" practices. 

2. No real options in regards to ""regular"" ball park food, the Brats are a joke and at 6 bucks a pop, they don't even offer peppers and onions, strange that it shows it in the menu picture. Other than that it's just another typical ""let's capitalize all we can"" with your typical crap chains (Fridays, Panda Express, etc) which I find pretty disgusting.  

3. The ""Value"" beer stands..... Okay, when is a beer a ""value"" at 4 dollars, I mean  seriously, being that I just paid 6 bucks for a brat that's pretty pathetic I'd at least like the decency of having a good size beer to help wash down the piss boiled frank I just overpaid the crap out of for. To sum it up, the value beer is tiny and the only one worth buying IMO is the 9 dollar 24 ouncer or even better, the 10.50 Corona, HA.


Here's the PROS.

1. Damn good deal on seating prices, we sat in section 140 (lower level outfield) for 15 bucks a person, Not too shabby! 

2. The stadium is rather beautiful, for a stadium that is. 

3. There's a pool in the outfield, cool idea 

4. Parking is rather cheap (12 bucks) and has never seemed to be an issue.

5. Traffic control before and after games is surprisingly smooth

The waitress had to get the manager which took over 20 minutes, (gimme a break)  finally we took a 30 dollar gift card because we were so sick of 'arguing about it.

3rd time...  took a friend there.  again we ordered devils ale.  on the menu it was listed at one price... when we got the bill, it was almost twice as much.  We waited for our server to come back, she never did, she totally ignored us.

BUT, we usually arrive about noon and I end up sitting in the lobby until the room is available.  This time it was available at 3:35 PM.  I'm glad we called the day before and asked for it to be expedited since we're Starwood members and have stayed there several times before and would be arriving early.  I know they have a noon checkout, but, cmon, three and a half hours to clean a room?!  They guarantee the room will be ready at 4 so I guess I should count my blessings that I got in 25 min. early.

Maybe it was just that we decided to dine in 10 minutes prior to closing, but I was definitely not impressed. I had not been here in ages. Probably 10 years, maybe 15. No exaggeration. I remember nothing but good things about Miracle Mile. I remember being excited to come eat here. 
So one night while shopping at Arrowhead with a friend, I got a sudden craving for a pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and Thousand Island dressing. I was very excited to walk in and find that it was on the menu! I didn't have to special order it!
It was a good size sandwich.  Big enough that when cut in half, you still have to use both hands. I took my first bite and was immediately disappointed. Not that it was bad. It's just that I had fond memories of this place and I was really expecting something near the level of perfection of the #19 at Langer's in Downtown L.A.....or at the least Like Gandolfo's in Tempe. Nope. It was nowhere near as good as either restaurant.  It was just okay. The bread had a slight toughness like it was day old bread. The meat was chewy and lacking flavor. The coleslaw was really good and had the perfect crunch. The flavor of the coleslaw was not strong, but still masked the flavor of the pastrami. I will stick with Jason's or Heidi's next time I have a hankerin' for another deli style sandwich.",2010-06-25
3989,1488,3041,"The queso is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade tortillas are also outstanding.

Aside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!

We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.

We started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it.

We ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions).

Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be ""more than a pile of onions,"" that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.

So much potential, but it fails on almost everything. It's a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...

This time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that ""we're not dirty, it's just the food smell."" Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!

And the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out.

The people who did get food complained that it was terrible. Maybe I should be happy I didn't get any food. When I asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it. The guys in the kitchen were overheard saying ""f---k those people no more orders! not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back. We ended up at Dennys eating eggs at 11:00 . Seriously I've never had such a bad experience in my life. Can you imagine paying for a dinner then being refused the dinner or a refund? unbelievable",2010-04-15
8681,1497,5752,"Decent menu which includes the traditional satay, tom yum koong, curries, pad thai etc. What threw me off was teriyaki, sweet and sour chicken, kung pao, chow mein. Food is good with great portions! Careful on the heat scale. 10 is blazin...
Weird thing....I was really thirsty after the meal. Usually that's the result of using the other type of SaLt. 
Overall the place is clean, modern, and staff are attentive. Curries are 10 bones, Fried rice at 9, and most entrees at 9 bones! Price is a buck plus more than our So Cal places. Give it a try, food is good, and service is fast.

The menu had a wide variety of tempting Asian treats but I was here for fish, so I ordered the sashimi combo with a bowl of Miso.

The soup was a bit odd.  It seemed to be normal Miso soup with some shredded cabbage tossed in.  The cabbage added a texture that I didn't really want but it was easy to eat around it.

The presentation of the sashimi was interesting.  I had a pinwheel of fishy goodness with yellowtail, smoked salmon and tuna.  The fish tasted quite fresh and the portions were generous.

9268,1361,6059,"Ahh, the crave.  Having grown up Vietnamese, I consider myself something of an expert on Vietnamese cuisine.  So I've had great (of course, my grandmother's and mother's food is 5 star), and I've had horrible.  Pho Van (putting accents on the vowels is difficult with an American keyboard, so I'm not going to bother) falls in the middle--not my favorite, but not too bad.

We started with appetizers.  Cha gio, which is a pork filled roll in a won ton wrapper, was okay.  It tasted not so fresh, but had good filling, and the Nuoc Mam (a fish sauce used to flavor) was okay.  My wife and I had Goi Cuon, which is a shrimp and pork, with vermicelli noodle rolled in a rice paper wrapper, was pretty good.  This is dipped in a  peanut sauce.

I had the basic Pho Tai.  This is a soup, typically pre-prepared by putting cooked rice vermicelli noodles at the bottom of a bowl, and then very thinly sliced beef, and then hot Pho broth poured over the soup to essentially reconstitute the noodles and cook the beef.  The secret to Pho is really the broth.  Typically, this needs to stand on its own to make a good judgement.  It does--it was flavorful, tasted fresh, and had a very rich flavor.  I was pleased.  For my own purposes, I do add Hoisin Sauce and Srirachi Hot Sauce.  Having eaten here once before, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.  The only criticism I would have of this Pho is that there's not enough of it.  The standard bowl did not have much in the way of noodles or beef.  For $8, I was hoping for more food.

The rest of my family members had Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio.  This is a traditional dish with rice vermicelli noodles, barbecued pork, and cha gio, over which you pour Nuoc Mam.  There is a bed of fresh vegetables.  This is what I typically think of when I think of Asian Salad--it's bean sprouts, lettuce, mint, and cucumber.  The barbecued pork tasted quite good as did the Cha Gio, once again.  I found this food quite good as well.  

The restaurant was very clean, relatively quiet.  There's a very pretty fish tank.  The decor was very nice.  The staff was attentive, and service was quick.  I note though that it was 5:30pm on a Friday, and the restaurant was unbusy.  The Nuoc Mam smelled very funny to me though--I'm used to the smell of this food additive, and this one smelled quite odd to me.  We are talking about something called ""fish sauce"" though, so I'm sure there are variants.  It tasted fine so no worries.  Staff needs to use cleaner towels when they wipe the tables as it does leave its own smell as well.",2011-12-10

I'll type the one sarcastic comment that I can't get out of my head and then I'll get to the more substantial feedback.  I thought a detail was supposed to be a little more DETAILED.

Here are the positives, because I want to give credit where credit is due.  The guys come to you and are very polite.  They were a little delayed, but called to let me know which I appreciated.  Also, they do a great job at steam cleaning the carpets and the exterior wax job was awesome.

On to the negatives.  When I came out to see the work they did, I immediately noticed several smudges in the interior which they cleaned after I pointed them out.  Also, I noticed a scratch on the passenger side leather seat and a hole punched in the carpet near the pedals.  Anyone who knows me knows that I am a DETAIL oriented person.  Those defects were not present in my car prior to this job.  To add to this bit of a let-down, a day later my boyfriend and I noticed that they didn't even touch my trunk!  They didn't even bother to vacuum it out!

When you advertise on your website ""showroom quality,"" I expect showroom quality.  Overall review: good job on the exterior, attention to detail in the interior was very poor.

The texture of the pasta was funky, hanging out on its own.
If I wanted bland pasta I would buy a can of Presto and penne pasta, boil them together and add some water :p

I consider myself to be a huge fan of Asian cuisine. Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Indian. You name it, I'll eat it. I have my healthy moments, but I am a seasoned eater and I am not afraid of exploring the world through my palate.

Mekong is the perfect place for me to massage my senses. The aroma and sensations from the exotic product. The stunning visual of a catfish being bopped on the head, and then cut up and packaged. The cheesy elevator music on the loudspeaker. The delicious taste of a spring roll from the hot food bar.

8707,2070,5767,"Came here for dinner and dim sum. Dinner probably deserves 5 stars but dim sum was probably 3 stars, so I'll just average my experience to 4 stars. 

Food: 
Dinner: There's these dishes that are on sale right now for less than $10 and most of them are clay pot dishes (which are DELICIOUS!). All the dinner items we ordered were AMAZING! Especially the green beans! Those were flavored and stir fried to perfection! I've had this dish many times at many different places and this was by far the BEST green bean dish I've ever had! The clay pots were ALL amazing! Everything tasted SOOO GOOD! 

Dim sum: Not enough dim sum items and the ones that did show up were only ok. We were sitting around for a really long time and nothing would come. When the ladies did come by with the carts, they would not even try to sell us anything. We had to be all proactive and ask everyone what's in the carts. Even when we did that, the ladies would just say ""nothing new"" and push the cart away. We had to order things from the kitchen but even those things would take forever to come. A few of the dim sum dishes we ordered came AFTER we asked for our check and paid already. 

Service: 
Dinner: Great service! No complaints there!
Dim sum: REALLY SLOW...why was there no food??? 

Ambiance: 
This restaurant is in the middle of a food court of a shopping plaza. They just put up dividers to section off the ""restaurant"" from the rest of the food court. I was hesitant to eat at this place, but I'm glad I did because dinner was amazing! Dim sum...that's a different story. If you get over the fact that you are really sitting in the middle of a food court, then it's not so bad. 

Price: 
Both dinner and dim sum items were pretty cheap. 

Overall:

First off, it bills itself as a steak/chop house or American Grill- whatever that is.  It is not a Steakhouse, despite have butcher in the name.

Lets start with the ambiance:  Don't ever sit in the back room, it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum.  Also, what is up with the TV?  If I wanted to watch TV while I ate I would stay at home, or go to a sports bar.

Next the service:  It sucked.  There must have been 20 Servers, yet service was slow and inattentive.  I know the place is new, but they did not even have a wine list printed.  When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.

Drinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.   

Now the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here.
No value

Food:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak.
My mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.

Dessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.

Value:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less! For example,  We had dinner at the Tuck shop the night before, the meal was great, and drinks and dinner was $80 Total!",2011-03-21

4412,2537,3311,"My wife and I almost always head in the direction of Bell Road for lunch or dinner. Today I decided to head west and south. Saw Taps they were new to this shopping center. 
Taps looks like a sports bar when you enter. Only thing there appears to be only 2 TVs or at least where we were sitting I could only see two both above the bar. The decor is appealing, fresh, lots of light coming in from outside. 
We were seated and very soon offered drinks. When the drinks came to the table we had both decided on their special.  Soup and Salad. With this you get a tomato soup, as much as you want and a choice of several salads again as much as you want. 
Not sure why but lately I have had a hard time getting soup that is hot. The soup came out at somewhere well below the state required 130 degrees. We sent it back asking to warm it up. We got it back it was warmer but still not hot. My wife's salad came out with her soup my salad came out a little later. I got the wedge. My soup and salad was very good. My wife also liked her meal. So the food gets a 4.
The service was very slow. It took over 15 min to get the first of our meal to the table. I did order a second different salad as well as did my wife. This also took about 15 min to bring to the table. For what was going to be a quick lunch we were there about an hour. There was only 5 other tables in the place with people at them so the reason for being slow was not that it was crowded. 
The plates bowles they used to serve the food in is extremely small. By the time you had eaten you salad it was all over the table. It is impossible to keep in the small bowel it is served in. If you put the same amount of feed in a larger bowel it would be much better. 

The food was good, the service was not so good. Soup needs to be hot not warm.

It was as if we were held hostage and could not leave for a full 25 minutes because that's how long it took to receive hour check after several requests to several different employees.  Female servers might be somewhat cute but know absolutely nothing about beer and this is a brewpub.  I asked if they have an seasonal beers and the reply was no, that they only sell their own beers!  Even more amusing is their ""industrial pale ale"" is an IPA but it is not bitter.  So, they say it's an IPA but it's not bitter, it's not a true-to-style IPA.  Then people say ""Oh I don't like IPA's"" and want something else.  Their attempt to rename a beer/style is actually hurting them.  Amazing.

6043,1180,4296,"I saw the reviews of this Arribas and thought to myself, ""Are these people talking about the same Arribas I went to last night?"" I went there, and had an awesome time! Service was prompt, and if something was off, our server Jeff (who was amazing) explained why something happened, but didn't blame anyone, and didn't use server jargon. I do understand the jargon, but it was nice for someone to not have to resort to it. 

Warm chips and salsas + warm bean dip came out = awesome and the spicy salsa was calling my name. It burned, but I loved it. I ordered the Rio Grande enchiladas with the carne abodoba, and ordered it extra spicy. (Of course, I would) I was with my girl (and she likes strawberry margaritas) so we split the house margarita for 2, frozen with sugar of course. I'm not a huge margarita person, but it was really good. She ordered the cheese enchiladas. (She takes safe choices when we go eat) -more on the margaritas in a min- 

Food come out and seriously, it was some of the best spanish/mexican I've had in a while. Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food. It was fresh! Which is hard to find these days and I'm pretty sure the people who own Arribas own a hatch chile farm because I rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros. Which is cool. Those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70's. I'm not kidding, when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want. Black, pinto, or the 3rd kind that is a combo of black/pinto with some onion, tomatoes, and of course, what's that? Hatch chiles! I highly recommend them. I liked how Arribas uses the hatch chiles. It sets them apart. It brought the heat!

After dinner, I ordered another margarita...

This time, I asked Jeff of a recommendation. Why do I do this? Because the people that work at any restaurant know the food/drinks there more than you will ever know. 'Nuff said. He brought out some margarita I don't even know the name. It kicked my ass, thank god my girl was driving home, that's all I'm going to say. Thanks!

That's why this place gets 5 stars. It deserves it in my opinion.
I think because this place takes chances with seasoning and overall outlook is why so many people might be unhappy with Arribas or this location in general. I on the other hand PROMOTE this thought process. I don't want food that's bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food. That makes for a BLAND place that's filled with, well, bland people. This place uses heat, salt, pepper, and other spices that I don't know of. What a freaking great idea! Too hot for you? Then don't eat food that is 99% based on heat.

I have never had a problem with the way my drink tasted until that day, but apparently the problem lies with me.

9519,284,4090,"In the interest of full disclosure the only thing I every really go here for is the lunch buffet but wow, what a great buffet! I believe the buffet itself is about $10 and for that you get a wide range of vegetarian items and as with other items on the buffet most of those get changed out over time so you get a rotation of various dishes as you come back. They also have hummus and baba ghanoush (like hummus but made with eggplant instead of chickpeas). There is generally at least one dish with red meat (today it was a tomato based stew with eggplant and either beef or lamb) and usually two dishes with chicken.

I generally get iced tea to go with the meal and one thing to note, they do not serve alcohol so if you want to go someplace where you can also have a drink or two, this would not be a good place to go but if you just want a place with really good Middle Eastern food (the owners told me it is really Lebanese cooking but I'm going to just generalize and say for most of us, when you try it, you will think Middle Eastern). Of course, you can walk a block or two to 4 peaks brewery, in the same area, and have a drink or two before or after you your meal. 

One really nice thing about this place it is right off the Apache stop on the light rail and right across the road (same side of the street) is Pita Jungle so a wide range of good food options right off that light rail stop.

Bottom line, I've never had anyone I've taken here NOT like it and everyone who has gone has wanted to go back again. I like it for lunch during the workday because it is quick and you have a wide variety of regularly changed out tasty food options, so I recommend you give it a try if you have the time. :-)",2011-09-30

There is one Asian lady i like a lot i forgot her name though my fault. I also got a pedicure from them as well they did good.

PROS:
* inexpensive 
* good color selection
* nice people
*television available

CONS:
*Some of my tips are longer than others
*When i got a pedicure the water was so hot it burned me feet and they came out of the water looking like cherry tomatoes
*whenever i seem to give them the tip off my visa they seem almost disappointed since its not cash (i dont carry cash and im not starting anytime soon)
*the language barrier but its no one's fault
*the massaging pedi chairs are made for people taller than me *sigh*

Since the cons outweigh the pros it gets 3 stars but you are still getting really good service considering how much you pay for it and i will continue to give them my business because the lady who gave me the pedicure was really nice and she did a really good job getting rid of my callouses and didnt torture me too bad (im extremely ticklish).",2010-06-30

6846,237,3871,"If you haven't been to this place - go! Seriously. It's amazing. It's the best little hole-in-a-rundown-strip-mall you can find. And it's cheap!

Nestled between stores like Big Lots and some electronic place with Mexican ranchero music blasting, this tiny place is hidden in the corner. The owner is from El Salvador, so don't expect it to be Mexican food -- there are many similarities, but the dishes themselves are different.
Walking in, you can smell the homemade pupusas -- seriously, it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central America. It's amazing. There are only a couple waitresses, and I don't think they speak much English, but the menu is in pictures, as well as in Spanish and some English, so you should do just fine.

Get the pupusas - they're like thick, hand-made tortillas stuffed with either pork, cheese and beans or, my favorite, cheese and loraco flower, which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus, to me. It's definitely the best one. These things come with salsa and some coleslaw (if they don't, just ask for the salsa) and are very filling!
The other dishes are really good, too. For a low price, you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans - and this place doesn't skimp on the fixin's. They put slices of fresh tomatoes, avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates.
I honestly LOVE it here. If you want to avoid the crowds, come at an off-hour... then you can just sit, relax and watch the telenovela on the TV in the corner. For dessert, pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash register.
I can't recommend this place enough!",2007-12-06

I don't know what a bad boy favorite even means but it has to be good especially since I've had his food and was quite impressed. 

I decided to make the 45 minute drive from Scottsdale out there on a Sunday afternoon to get my olive oil and try this kalamata sandwich. Such a cool atmosphere inside. It's like a trader joes/gift shop/paradise bakery all with a rural, kinda on the farm feel. You could easily kill an hour here just looking around at all the stuff for sale.  

I couldn't believe the kalamata sandwich! If you go there and order anything else....you're wrong. Freshest ingregients I've ever tasted. I feel like the pork could have just been butchered 5 minutes prior to me ordering it and the vegetables just picked from their garden (which they do have there). 

Pretty cool how you can sample the endless flavors of olive oil there. Got myself the vanilla bean and the blood orange as well. Make for some unstoppable pancakes. 

Tried the gellato and wasn't all that impressed. But in all due fairness, I'm not exactly sure what real gellato is supposed to taste like since all I've had is gelleto spot and grateful spoon.

LGO is on the pricey side, and definitely caters to those who want to eat gourmet/designer pizza. however, taste wins out with all the fantastic and fresh toppings. and if you ever get sick of franchise restaurants a la CPK, LGO is a great alternative.",2007-10-10

2072,1463,331,"I was inspired to visit Casella's after a coworker told me about their authentically Italian goodness. As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'! 

While I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner. 

In summary, here's what made Casella's stand out: 

- The very friendly staff
- It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses! 
- Clean decor 
- Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see 
- A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside. 

I'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular.

UB's seems to be hosting a slew of Metal shows over the next 3 months, which is good to see a place open it's arms and bar to the metal community. 

As far a heavy metal venue goes, its run of the mill. It has enough room to either mosh or sit in the booths along the back wall. 

As far as the bar, the prices seemed slightly on the high side, especially for the ""dive-ness"" this place exhibits. 
Their beer menu had 4 or 5 typos on it, just something to chuckle at, such as Rolling Rook beer, O'Dools, and listed Fat Tire as an import. (Cuz Colorado is SO FAR way).

2136,1496,177,"I went to Saba's feeling a little scared.  Fast food Greek in a strip mall?  This could go one of two ways...surprisingly good or health code violation bad.  

I am very glad to say it didn't end being the latter.  In fact, the food here was pretty damn good.  I did expect Saba's to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order.

The menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, you're going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches don't come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal.

The dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like ""I like it loose, like my women,"" is just not funny.

Anyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.  That was a little annoying, but overall, Saba's is a good choice for a quick Greek meal.",2007-07-19

In the small space in front of the counter the staff was in perpetual motion squeezing past each other to get drinks, etc.   My cheddar, jalepeno, sausage omelette was very good, but not huge, and the hash browns were crisp and tasty on the outside but soggy on the inside.  The whole wheat toast was great, but no choice of toppings...I was given a small dollop of peach preserves.

I really like that they don't even try to push product on you, unlike many other salons, and they give you a mini-massage before your shampoo.

I took a star away because of a bad experience I had with one of their aestheticians about 2 years ago. She put Retinol on my eyelids, which is a no-no.

I recently was in the store asking about a certain item by Susan Lenart Kazmer, the person looked right at me and said oh we don't carry that artist you might try hobby lobby they get a little credit for trying to help but Susan's line is a Michaels only item.  I gave the woman the line name and said no we don't carry that I'm sure.  I pointed at the huge display in front of me of Susan items and her answer, Oh that must be brand new.  I said nope it came out three years ago now can you see if you have this specific item she said oh we can't do that and she walked off talking to her friend the only other employee in the store that i had seen.   Ok bad but any store can have a bad employee right.  so I go up to pay, a pleasant young girl asks me if I have a Michael's card?  I say sure do and hand it to her.  Oh that's not a Michaels card ours are red.  I explain that it's a gold card for people who spend more money and that as a professional artist I'm there quite a bit.  She says I've never heard of that before.  Well it's a Michaels card just read the front it says Michaels right there.  she stands looking at me so I said try scanning it I promise it will work.  She scans it and then says oh it says you have a $5  off coupon loaded on this card.  My response;  good you get a five dollar coupon for every 100 you spend.  Now she looks scared and says the dreaded words I'm not sure,  let me call the manager.  So 20 minutes go by and who shows up the lady that argued about the Susan Lenart items.

I knew he didn't have an obstruction or other emergency issue, but I was concerned about parasites.

The receptionist, Hilary, was super sweet on the phone and in person. She was upfront with what tests she thought would be ordered, and how much it would run me (and it wasn't an arm and a leg; the office call was only $56). I was very happy they'd be able to see me the next morning, but then she called back not 20 minutes later with a cancellation and said to come on in. Even better! 

The tech was very good with Nately's 40 pounds of squirming, and loved on him the whole time. I was also happy they let me help hold him - I've been to vets that called in a 2nd tech, like the owners aren't capable of safely holding their own dog.

Dr. Newland was AWESOME.

- Other vets: ""Oh my God, we need to run $500 worth of expensive tests and start him on multiple medications"", general sense of admonishment for not rushing him to their affiliated ER clinic, eagerness to run the bill up, very few questions about anything, etc... 
-Dr. Newland:  Super calm and personable. He spent 20 minutes going over everything (Nately's last few days of activity and stomach issues, diet, contact with other dogs, where I take him in public, anything he could think of really), felt his abdomen thoroughly, and said ""Honestly, he's a puppy, they eat funny things, and something probably just irritated his stomach. He's plainly feeling pretty good, so just feed him a bland diet, give him this medication to settle his stomach, and bring a stool sample just in case, so you know for sure he's parasite-free"".  He also dispensed advice for Nately's general care, as long as we were there, about heartworm prevention and  necessary vaccines, etc. I even got a good education on the different types of parasites and which were even likely in AZ's climate (turns out, not many). I really appreciated that he didn't try to frighten me into expensive diagnostics and possible serious diseases, and that he is so on his game and scientific/logical about things.

I am very impressed and will be making Adobe my regular vet for as long as possible. If only they treated birds too!",2013-01-02
16,16,16,"Was it worth the 21$ for a salad and small pizza? Absolutely not! Bad service. Maybe the guys grandma died I don't know. I want to tell you what really made me mad about the experience. We order the small pizza and salad and the guys could have cared less and took our $ and we sat down. We were looking around and hmm, there's a sign saying ""x large pizza and large salad only 23$"". Wow that would have been nice if the guy told us that. I left hungry, mad and unsatisfied. 

To the owner: teach your employees the value of upselling and telling the specials. Something so small can affect a customers experience negatively. 

And your salads are severely overpriced

9396,4035,5915,"I don't know what it is about Tempe Sales, but how can you not love them? it is primarily a fabric store, and they may or may not have all kinds of other random stuff, like carved wooden chairs, stone tabletops, bamboo flooring (sadly no longer in stock), slate tiles, and so on.

However, I would say that it's not merely the random selection of home decorating supplies and upholstery tools/materials that makes Tempe Sales great. It's the family-run vibe that you get from them. On one trip, to pick up several cases of flooring material, I had to go with the owner Alan to his warehouse down the street. In light of buying as much as I did and helping pull it from the warehouse, he threw in plenty of sublayment material for free (otherwise on closeout). The staff (many of whom are part of the family) have also helped me reupholster furniture and work on plenty of other odd jobs. There is no shame in being an amateur at Tempe Sales, even though it is primarily geared toward professionals.

If you're in the market for fabric, please do yourself a favor and check it out. I bet that you will return soon thereafter just to browse around some more. The only downsides that come to mind also make the experience more interesting -- stock levels are not always reliable and parts of the store have historically been disorganized (much better now than in the past), but my experience may be skewed since I gravitate toward closeout deals.",2011-06-02

5662,620,4073,"Oh Man. This is not the place I imagined I would assign my first 2-star rating. I woke up as sad and disappointed as I felt last night, leaving the legendary, old school Durant's after an evening of less than mediocre food and terrible service. Sigh.

Honey had a great lunch there a few months back and was excited to impress me with dinner. We saw Durant's listed on Restaurant week and were excited for the excuse to squeeze into one of their comfy booths amidst the bow-tie clad staff and velvet wallpaper. The instant time travel type setting usually makes for an incredible dining experience. Shall I fault the poor rating to their efforts at succumbing to a prix-fixe menu? Perhaps.

Our time at the bar proved to be the best part of the night. Watching the bartender mix the martini's the way my Pops used to was nostalgia at its best. I LOVED that they serve bottles of beer with a toothpick of meat and cheese. That is brilliant. It could transform me into a beer drinker after all. We met up with friends and continued on to the dinner portion of the evening.

Moving on to the booth, our waitress was definitely in the weeds. Having been in her shoes before, I always try and accommodate the situation. We ordered an appetizer and a few cocktails and waited to order dinner when she seemed able. Appetizer of artichoke dip was yummy. Tortillas and garlic bread and warm, cheesy dip delivered promise.

The limited menu was just that. Okay first course salad/soup options. Main course offered Pot roast, a small steak or chicken fried steak. Stewed steak, grilled steak or fried steak. Really? Your menu is impressive...if you really don't want to participate in Restaurant week, then don't. 

Honey ordered the chicken fried steak as a continuation of the old school vibe. I ordered the trout off the regular menu after C pointed out the fish option. J ordered the cfs too. 

Food took a bit, but we had good conversation flowing, so it wasn't a problem. Salads and soup were fine. Main course arrived and we were all a bit surprised by the size of the fried steak. I guess when you think of this meal from the past, it encompasses half the plate and is oozing with country gravy. This steak was the size of a burger and had a dollop of thick gravy-esque goo on the top. Garlic mashers were appropriately placed. 

My trout was supposed to be topped with a lemon caper sauce but instead it was slathered with a gravy that hinted at lemon and was all wrong for a fish. The trout was pain-fried and should there have been a light sauce, it would have been good. But the fried fish with the gravy was just so not good. 

The fried steak too, so not good. Mashers achieved an appropriate level of goodness, but you really don't want mashed potatoes to lead your dinner. 

We were devastated. 
The whole experience was so not what we came for or expected. I do want to give Durant's another chance and order a big, juicy steak and let them wow me like they do to so many, but it will be a while before our trek downtown includes a walk through their kitchen.",2010-09-19

8517,3824,1097,"I can't believe we get to review a free publication.  Nonetheless, it's important to know (especially for Dave B., who obviously didn't do his research) that this magazine is published by a gentleman who grew up here in the valley and wanted a way to promote all of the great, creative people and activities they are doing by making a free magazine.  He decided this 17 years ago, and, despite pretty much breaking even (it costs money to print and distribute thousands of magazines and no, the ads do not cover the full cost), continues doing so in the name of cultural awareness.  Notice that the photoshoots use local designers, local models, local photographers, and local locations.  The articles are about artwork currently displayed in local galleries, businesses (like restaurants) and bands that local folks have started on their own from meager means, and about up-and-coming events like the taco festival (started by a local), fashion shows (again, utilizing local designers and run by locals - no Dillard's show coverage here) and about people in the valley who are trying to make a difference in our community.  If the magazine doesn't seem critical enough, it's because the people who are the magazine decide what to write about, and therefore don't have to waste pages with hateful criticism when Java can be promoting a local chef or a cool new local jewelry designer.  When it's run by a local, written by locals, and put together in the publisher's dining room, I can't think of any magazine with MORE credibiilty and freedom.  The publisher and writers are meticulous in choosing to write about what moves them rather than what the latest hype is.  That's why you read a story about the man who purchased a building and was designing it into a venue before it was the Crescent Ballroom.  That's also why you'll read the backstory on five locally owned, little-known coffee houses at far ends of the valley.  The candid shots in the back are a tribute to local events the publisher attended but maybe an article hasn't been written about, or to local artists, designers or patrons of the arts.  While it's always interesting to hear what people think of Java, knowing what really goes on behind the scenes gives me nothing but respect for the handful of folks to who put their blood sweat and tears into creating this free publication each month.",2012-02-17

Dragonfly combines what I like about Vietnamese food (variety, flavor, price) with what I like about a modern, trendy restaurant (good decor, modern music, attentive servers). 

Though everything on the menu is above average, one item really stands out; cha gio cream cheese. I believe at this location it's called tiger rolls. Completely inauthentic, and I couldn't care less. DAMN they're good. When I drive in from San Diego, I often head there on my first night in town, occasionally as soon as I hit the Phoenix area, before stopping off to drop off my bags.

3702,1183,2852,"The first couple of times I ate here I wasn't sure why people were always so crazy for this place. It's been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months I've already been here like three times and wanted to go back more. I've decided that it's all about what you order; for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings, have fun! Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try. Also, don't be afraid to speak up. I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didn't pay attention. Now I ask for lots of lettuce and they're happy to make it the way I like. They make their breads fresh and they have garlic-herb bread that has lots of flavor. I won't order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing. I am a picky ranch eater...I hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesn't taste or resemble mayo. I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor. They have the best home made ranch dressing here! Pair it with the garlic-herb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor. OMG! Wipe...sorry I just started to drool a bit. Service is good...everyone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant. My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwich...I get the Pinner (8"") but I swear some days I am so hungry I think I'm going to order the Blunt (12"")...maybe someday soon. All sandwiches get toasted. Okay so toppings: Guacamole, sprouts, lettuce/spring mix, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, black olives (I get mine w/o), cucumbers, pickles, your choice of cheese (I get Swiss), with their house goodies (EVOO, vinegar, herb mixture on top). Now that I found my sandwich, I crave it all the time and can't wait for my next visit. Oh, be sure to check their daily specials too!

I love their 3 piece dark meat rotisserie chicken that comes with a delicious cornbread (I'm usually not fond of cornbread) and two choices of sides. I've had the creamed spinach, corn, veggie mix, squash mix, roasted herb red potatoes and sweet yam which is my least favorite....the sweet yam casserole is just too sweet for my taste...so not a big fan of that one..other than that the other sides are pretty good. The meatloaf meal is also really good...two really good size slice of meatloaf also with a choice of two sides and a cornbread...2 bucks more expensive than the chicken but sometimes you want something besides chicken. heh

9882,1423,6347,"Ive been to F&H on numerous occasions. The night usually goes a little like this..

  I walk up to the entrance, I see people smoking outside in a small fence area. I look over and see these groups are starring at me like i just blatantly readjusted myself in public.  I give them one more glance and realize in two hours we all will all be best friends exchanging pointless stories about our days when in reality I couldn't give a flying f*[% about their new kitten they adopted and named Bunbun. But in 2 hours I will thrive and cherish each of their stories and be amazed I never found such intellectual people sooner.

 Before I get to the door I feel eyes spying on me. I look up to find  one of 17 hostesses peering through the window ready to yank the door open a mere second before I reach for it. (you can't beat them to this..  Ive tried several times, they are good at what they do. Just prepare for this and accept it.) 

as I step inside my eyes automatically affix to the bar top. I scan up and down the row of seats. As I'm scanning down I see two empty seats. I'm not sure if guy code applies to bar seats like the bathroom urinals (guys.. You know what I'm talking about)..  But I usually just start the night off not giving a...  Because I already aknowledge the fact things are only going to degrade from here anyways.

 I start with a tall miller light and look up at the game playing on the TV's. I continue my beer almost empty then order some beer battered buffalo chicken tenders with extra ranch. I look into the reflection of my phone to make sure my face isn't suddenly disfigured because she looks at me as if I just asked for an order of wine and chive biscottes. 

I explain that I am looking to get the beer battered buffalo wings then she calls for backup like I'm speaking a foreign language.  ""Hey Lacey! This guy wants beer battered buffalo chicken wings"" they say some things, fumble a bit then come back with..  So you want ""chicken tenders and ranch?"".  I explain again to the both of them. They both tilt their heads to the side. Either this one beer slammed me, and I'm speaking nonsense at this point, or they just don't understand what buffalo wings are.   ""so..you want a cheeseburger and a side of buffalo sauce sir?"". They do a little further team planning and come up with a solution and I end up with beer battered chicken tenders dry as a bone with no sauce and a side of buffalo sauce. My friend getting the opposite  when we both ordered the same thing except he gets no buffalo sauce and a side of ranch.. I find it to bother me less and less each time because I expect it now.  

Their food really is good, and their service is...Did i mention that their food is really good? 

I look back up at the TV acting real smooth and care free only to realize ive been watching female tennis on the television next to me for the past 30 minutes while everyone eIse is attentively watching the football game. I'm not ashamed to admit that I continued watching it. I think it was the loud grunts that kept my attention. I finish eating, grab another beer and me and the friend approach the ping pong table. 
You need to go to the hosts stand to get the equipment. It's free. Wait no it's not..  It's a dollar. Nope that was last month. Now it's 9 bucks an hour. Better empty those pockets. Just remember every hour you waste playing you could have fed 27 starving ethiopians for  a month. But in your drunken stooper you chose to dish out the $9 like myself and play pool or ping pong. Shame on you.

PS.., beware of the twins...  I thought I was loosing my mind after a few beers seeing one girl cover the whole restaurant in a matter of mere seconds. If you ask  your server for something and she looks at you funny...  it's either because you asked her twin, or you asked for buffalo chicken tenders.
Also... if you stay late enough the cops hide and wait for you to leave the parking lot as soon as you turn out. But of course you have a designated driver... right?

7918,433,2849,"So, not following my own advice (ahem, NEVER RETURN), I returned here for a friend's birthday dinner a few months ago (I super love this person so how could I say no?). HA! Big mistake. Also, fair warning: there are several-a-CAPS-LOCK ahead.

The only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group (15 people). And of course because we were celebrating a super special person.

I'll keep this update short and sweet:

$3 for a CAN OF SODA? Get real. I knew it'd be overpriced but I was at least expecting a mini bottle or something. But a can? COME ON. You bought that in bulk and paid .03342 cents for it. FAIL.

Your servers: IDIOTS. First it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders. Then she's back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again. Did you forget? Were you not paying attention the first time we around? Why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks? And on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO RECEIVE DRINKS IS BAD. Very, very bad. 

Also, not taking food orders until after we've been seated for ONE HOUR is BAD. VERY, VERY BAD. Seated at 8 o'clock, we didn't receive our food until almost TEN O'CLOCK. TWO HOURS FOR FOOD IS VERY, VERY BAD. Do you hear that, St. Francis? BAD.

Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner, and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil, I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer (and add on a $3 can soda). Funny, that our bill was still nearly $30 for the both of us. Excluding tip. BAD.

Also, server: If you say you're not going to split a check, stick to your word or don't even try. Now, I'M glad you didn't stick to your stingy ""I don't split checks"", because I could foresee the mess of trying to split a $700 bill with 13 people I didn't know so well. Lucky for us, when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check, you split it for us. A couple others caught on and did the same, but the remaining 7-8 people were not so lucky. 

Because I realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore (or sweet, for that matter), I'm ending it here. NOTE TO SELF: heed own advice and stay away from St. Francis!",2010-08-22

9583,1515,4158,"I went to Blanco Tacos + Tequila in Scottsdale with my family for my birthday dinner. This is another one of Sam Fox's restaurants, and it serves up modern Mexican fare. Our party of five all got a ton of food that definitely required to-go boxes throughout the meal.

The atmosphere at Blanco totally didn't surprise me, considering it's a Fox eatery. There was the open kitchen, huge hanging lights, centrally located bar and airy feel. It was chic and dimly lit with candlelight, but there were televisions throughout broadcasting football games. It was a great mix of casual and fancy, making it the type of place where it's perfectly acceptable to go and just down a couple margaritas, or have a fun dinner date.

I started with the Blood Orange Margarita ($9), which you should get with salt even though it's a little sweet. It was a strong drink, and the sweetness wasn't overpowering.

For my meal, I started with the housemade guacamole to go with our tasty chips and spicy salsa, then had cheese enchiladas and finished with a Tres Leche cake. The guacamole was so amazing, other people at the table were also inspired to order it for their starter. I really liked the cheese enchiladas, but, as my mom pointed out, they're more modern in that they're not smothered and dripping with cheese. Instead, they're covered in an interesting creamy ancho sauce. I guess I prefer traditional cheese enchiladas, but there was still a ton of cheese inside the tortillas that made me happy.

The cake was really interesting. Someone compared it to a bread pudding, since it was really crumbly and wet because it was drenched in a milky sauce. I liked it, but it was too rich to finish.

Altogether, I thought the meal was an excellent deal. I would definitely go back for the lively ambiance and tasty take on Mexican food.",2012-07-09

My mom says that she ate nachos w/ jalepenos on a regular basis while pregnant with me.  Maybe that explains it.  Anyway, I've been wanting to try this place forever since they claim to have ""the best tortillas in town.""  I seized the opportunity to check it out since I had to drop a friend off at the airport this morning.   

The exterior certainly leaves a lot to be desired, and the ambiance is about on par with the drunk tank at the fourth avenue jail (a good friend spent a most unfortunate night here and described it in detail).  The cold, stained cement floors, nasty old booths and 70's McDonald's style swivel plastic chairs which likely  needed a new coat of paint back in the early 80's.  I decided on a green chile burrito and my companion ordered the egg/chorizo/potato/cheese burrito.  After waiting for about 5-10 minutes, our number was called.  The first thing I noticed was that the burritos were quite small.   I knew, however, that I was in for a real treat with the piping hot, super chewy freshly made tortilla, and I was not disappointed.  The green chile, while tasty, had too much liquid and after inadvertantly puncturing my tortilla, I was left with a handful of sauce.  

I certainly felt more than safe inside this place (despite the somewhat scary clientele) based on the table of twelve Phoenix police officers sitting across from us.  Overall, I would give the atmosphere 1.5 stars, and the food 3.75 stars.

* The carne adovada was tender but not very spicy.

That said:
* The green salsa was really good.
* I'm so desperate for carne adovada, I'll settle. (besides, $9 is more than a fair price for 3 eggs, black beans and carne adovada in a bowl on a flour tortilla - even if it was more beans than pork.)

Most cheap drive through fast food Mexican places are alike. Of course there are slight differences. In this case it wasn't for the better.

We had to drive up to the window to order. The speaker box wasn't working? What was going on there?

I ordered a chicken chimichanga with sour cream & guacamole on the side. The chimi was big, just like I expected it to be. There wasn't much guacamole. I would have liked more. They also put tomatoes in it. That's ok, I'm just mentioning it. All in all this chimi just didn't sit as well as others I've had. Maybe it was the spices they used that were different, I'm not sure.

7716,3595,526,"I went to Pei Wei last night for a casual girls' night dinner.  It was a perfect place for a group of girls to meet because of the following:

-it's cheap
-it's fast casual so each person pays their own bill and then sits down (no stress when the bill comes as is often the case with groups)
-there is plenty to choose from on the menu
-for those that are picky or dieting, they are great about special orders, sauce on the side, etc...

That being said, Pei Wei is just average in my eyes; never my first choice of places to go, but I can always find something to eat... Last night I had the shrimp teriyaki bowl with brown rice.  The shrimp tasted like it came from the freezer (probably because it did), but the veggies, rice, and sauce were all pretty good.  I noticed they changed the menu a bit since my last visit, and a new 'special' is a Vietnamese Noodle Bowl - Pho type dish.  The chicken lettuce wraps and edamame are always safe bets and hopefully will remain on their menu forever.

The best thing she did for us was encourage us to purchase travel insurance.  

When we arrived at our Miami hotel at 10:30pm the night prior to leaving for St. Lucia, we had discovered Sue had left us an urgent note to contact her.  We found out a hurricane had hit St. Lucia and all of a sudden our honeymoon plans starting crumbling apart.  Because of Sue and our travel insurance (thank goodness we listened to the expert on this one!), we were able to change our honeymoon to a Sandals resort in the Bahamas and didn't miss a beat.  Sue was in constant contact with us, which calmed the craziness I was feeling (and I'm sure my new husband was relieved).  The airlines even took care of our baggage fees on the way to the Bahamas.

I'm gonna be real with you. I am not in love with Pizzeria Bianco, and had I actually had to wait in line, this rating would probably be lower. My group was lucky enough to receive the last table without any wait.

Maybe it was the fact that it's hard to impress me with pizza. Maybe it was a fluke that won't happen again. At least that's what everyone keeps telling me.

4806,2691,963,"So, for more than a year, I drove by this place on my way to work but never checked it out. I wasn't sure what to make of a place with a walk-up takeout window. Last night, I followed a group of friends there for a late dinner. Didn't try any appetizers. I just split a 14' Italian special pizza--sausage, green olives and fresh garlic. The pizza was pretty good, not spectacular but definitely a couple steps above a place like Mamma Mia's whose pizza has a fast-food quality at times. Red Devil is very generous when it comes to toppings, at least on this one. I am an olive lover but haven't had green olives on pizza before. I enjoyed olives in every bite. But if you think olives are just okay, you might have found it a bit much. The pizza was kind of big for two people and with tax, it was about $18. So, I'd say it's fairly priced. 

I have to say that the service, more than the pizza, would draw me back. Servers who think of the little things before you even ask are much appreciated. We had a party of nine and our waiter was super patient. We also brought a birthday cake on the premises, which they allow. Our waiter started clearing all our plates and silverware and before I could ask, he said not to worry, he'd bring us clean plates and forks for the cake. He also saw someone with a camera and asked to take a picture. He just gave off a genuine vibe of being helpful. I would definitely consider it if in the mood for something casual but not carbon-copy fast food.",2009-01-07
4971,1152,1161,"Truly don't appreciate the pathetic TEASE they have by naming this place with initials, yet refusing to tell us what they actually mean.  If there isn't a clear meaning, then you're lame for having a name like this.  Please, drop the act.

They don't brew their own beers as of now.  They're contracted out by someone else (Grand Canyon I think, which doesn't have a good reputation for award winning beers).

Large tap selection, but sadly it is heavily skewed heavily towards Arizona beers which are not exactly highly rated, nor sought after by those really into great craft beer.  Luckily they still have some of the better regional beers from California & Colorado (among others) on tap as well.

Food is extremely high in price, excluding happy hour.  Maybe they'll do better than the failed German places in this location before it.",2012-01-12
3863,839,754,"This is my first review on Yelp so here you go...

I love Yasu!!  This is by far the best sushi and authentic japanese restaurant in Phoenix.  I have been there numerous times and it never disappoints.  

You have to try their Sumibiyaki which are items cooked over Japanese charcoal, last time I was there I had the beef tongue..sounds weird but its so good

Nigiri/sashimi are a must.  They always have the best selection and daily special, most important...its always fresh...this is definately important!!  The sweet shrimp is my personal favorite and anything else you order, you will find the fish is sliced with great execution.  

Request fresh chopped wasabi, you will never eat sushi with out it again!  

Love this place!!",2009-04-07

Came here for a happy hour, had a drink called the Tokyo Tease(delish!) and since I love sashimi sushi (which isn`t on the happy hour menu, no big deal), ordered my sashimi combo, which didn`t disappoint!!

I'm vegetarian, so I have no idea how their meat burgers taste, and they may be the best in the world for all I know, but the veggie burger was a tasteless lump for the most part.  I do give them kudos for having a veggie burger, but either put more effort into it, or take it off the menu and go full-on meat!

The service was nice, and I like the design of the place, but there are too many good veggie burgers to be had in the Valley to waste my time eating this one.  Parking lot is super-cramped, so if you need your meatburger fix, then don't come right at 12 or 6, unless you want to park in someone's yard.",2012-05-09

Well, unless I am just very unlucky and visited on a bad day, this Gelato Spot has gone steeply downhill. My husband ordered a strawberry-kiwi flavored and I chocolate peanut butter. We both agreed: the gelato tasted grainy, with noticable ice crystals. And worse, the flavorings tasted like they came from a bottle, not fresh.

Burritos, tacos and salads are the main items to choose from.

To our great surprise, we had one of the best Thai meals in a long time.  Once you get inside, you'll forget this used to be an old Pizza Hut and you'll be transported to a bit of Southeast  Asia.  Good food, good service...and the price is great.  I loved the eggplant with beef and the Pad See Yew (spelled differently).  Was going to go again, but they close on Sundays...boo.  Don't know if it's consistently this good, but for our one night in Phoenix, we were pleasantly surprised.  Definitely worth a try if you're looking for good Thai food.  You don't necessarily have to have a lot of heat in your food because they have plenty of dishes for chili-adverse people like me but it's there for those that need the heat.  The food presentation and description will remind you of Chinese cuisine, but the flavors are unique and delicious...and definitely NOT Chinese.  The Thai fried rice is definitely more than a side dish...it's a meal in itself.  Try this place and you won't be disappointed.",2010-03-28

We had the fried knocci for an appetizer with a fabulous marinara sauce - usually do not order knocci but these came recommended and were very good.  The bread was crusty on the outside & chewy on the inside -very yummy.  We sat at the bar as we usually do and the bartender brought over a sample of their meet sauce to try with more bread.  I don't eat meat sauce but my husband said it was very good.  I had a heft cosmo & my husband had a beer.  For dinner i had the pasta trio that was fabulous - probably the best italian food i've had since the cioppino at Allesia's restaurant.  My husband had the linguine with white clam sauce also very good.  I'm certain these pasta dishes were homemade because they just had amazing flavor - I wanted more!! We finished with tiramisu that was also really great.  My husband had coffee and even that was great.

This is not a one stop shop to find everything, however they seem to always have the items that work best for me. They don't have as many Safeway or Fry's grocery deals, but they have discounted items regulary to choose from. There prices are slightly higher then Trader Joes for the amount of food.

2968,1935,2372,"Went on a Saturday night using our Entertainment coupon (which listed old address, had to call for new, they gave a nice apology). There was a party going on behind screens, all Pakistanis, women & girls in traditional wear, balloons, lots of children that were literally running though the restaurant, squealing with delight. Very glad we were not expecting a romantic dinner... We approached it as cultural diversity, chose to enjoy the loud, festive atmosphere. OK... A little annoyed when one of the little girls did a few particularly high-pitched repeated squeals, & one kid bumped my chair as they chased each other across the restaurant...

It was less than an hour of closing, so we asked if the buffet was not such a good idea (been out a while, no fresh coming). The kid waiter went to ask, and we appreciate that he returned reporting that the menu would be a better choice to insure quality.

 Ordered lentil soup & sesame naan (new & listed on back pages). Lentil soup was soft yellow color, not darker lentils I'm used to. It was creamy with very small pieces of lentils. The flavor was more mild than I'm used to, but a subtle spicy. It was nice, no complaints. The sesame naan was fresh, crisp bottom, soft top layer, added a bit of salt and WOW delicious!! Lots of sesames on top, yum.

Then ordered chicken tikka masala, as I'm working my husband into such foods, and he for sure likes this dish. Nice white breast meat which he prefers, simmered in that divine red creamy sauce. I'd call it mild heat at best. I'd prefer a bit spicier, but perfect for my husband. 

We brought our beverage with us, after calling to make sure it was okay. Nothing is mentioned on the website one way or the other. They were very accommodating for this, brought us glasses, and offered an opener to use. I am under the impression there's a seating size limit to such places & not sure they don't exceed it, so I'm going to stay vague so they/we don't lose this option! It was GREAT - kept our bill nice and low.

If it wasn't for the Entertainment coupon, we wouldn't have known to try them... Now we will be back!

4 stars not five because it was really good but not mind-blowing... It would take a big wow to have me give 5. Children thing doesn't affect score, as I know that was a celebration exception, and again chose to see it as a cultural experience. Omar works part-time, very nice, friendly, good customer service. He apologized for the chaotic environment, which was nice. 

Saw grumpy uncle at counter, no smile, but we didn't have any interaction with him. We were waited on mainly by a nice kid with puffy black hair, seemed a bit timid but did fine with everything. Omar came to us and chatted at the end of the evening.",2012-08-12

Front desk staff were friendly and fast so check in was a breeze.  The room was great. Had 2 double beds in a separate room and a queen size pull out. Beds were comfortable and linens were above normal hotel quality. Bathroom was big...though it contained the closet which was kinda weird. Towels were over sized and very soft. Small balcony was nice.  Parking was in a structure next to the hotel and we never had a problem. Loved the atrium like interior of the hotel. 

The only cons I can think of were
...the elevators were kinda slow.
...the toilet didn't flush right away and you had to hold the handle down a few seconds.

This sort of ice cream order has raised a few brows, and furrowed some in the past, but not here, not these guys! And the couple of times, my rice-high (from the sushi place next door) son dropped his cone on the floor, they were so kind and understanding about it, they just scooped up the mess while they joked around with my little one about all the ice cream they've had to wipe off the floor in the past with other customers, and made him a fresh new cone, adding extra sprinkles, for good measure.

5993,3066,4270,"For those of you planning to visit us, Babaloo's is no more.  For those of you who know us I just wanted to take a minute to leave a heartfelt thank you.

When someone opens a new restaurant it is an exciting moment, a nervous moment, a scary moment all rolled into one.  If the worst thing that happens is a rack of wine glasses falling from the roof in a hail of glass then the opening can be considered a success-many have endured far more nightmarish openings in this industry.  

As the weeks, months, and years go by a funny thing happens to the special restaurants, the good restaurants: they begin to feel like family and people come back.  This was where I came in, almost a year ago today, as a simple restaurant server with over 10 years of previous restaurant management experience.  I was not the best server, but I noticed that both customers and employees alike were always grateful, and made me feel at home.  This was the beauty of Babaloo's-it felt like family.  

To Robert, Myra, George, Adam, Emily, Jon, Rob, Erika, and anyone I may have forgotten I offer my deepest thanks for allowing me to be part of your lives.  To all of the wonderful people who came to see us over and over again, I would far prefer to work a table seated with people I know, and you all never failed to help me out with that.  Babaloo's did not close because of the folks that supported us, it closed because sometimes in the bleakest economy a business fails, even despite the greatest efforts of those trying to keep it going.

For the most part, I can stop in and be seen within 5 minutes like today and get a $13 haircut. You can't beat it. Most of the time, I just need the end of my layers cleaned up and why would I want to spend $60 on a haircut to do that?  I have never had any problems with not getting what I wanted. Sometimes, I'll also spend the extra $20-$25 and have them shampoo and blow-dry my hair straight. My hair always looks great when I do that, too. Today, I spent $38 on the cut, shampoo and blow-dry. The blow-dry took alot longer than I wanted today, but Keeyla (sp?) also took the flat-iron to it. Clearly the girl takes pride in her work and my hair looks really great for someone with very coarse, wavy hair. Every once in awhile you can get coupons for an $8 haircut in the mailers.

2812,912,442,"I think its about time I wrote a formal review for this establishment, considering I have recently bestowed it as ""My Favorite Restaurant"" - that's a big title to carry. 

I often judge Mexican restaurants based solely on their chips and salsa and Gallo Blanco passes that test.  They have a delicious green tomatillo and smoky chipotle - as well as the typical hot sauce and fresh pico.  Their chunky guac is delish and summery, as they put orange slices in it. 

Although the chiccharon gets a lot of buzz (I think it taste like Cheez-Its), their best appetizer is the Elote - grilled corn-on-the-cob with cheese on it. It literally melts in your mouth! Oh, and it doesn't get stuck in your teeth like most corn-on-the-cobs tend to. 

The orange cake is AMAZING and reminds me of my beloved red velvet - except, you know, orange.

8201,35,5499,"This place used to be amazing.  My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents.  It's not the same anymore.

We went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.

We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.

The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.

While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.

So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down.",2009-08-10

Above the crowed, cooked to order food here is simply great.
Yes butter burger is a fun time but the real mean is their entrees 

Fried Chicken and Fried Cod, they keep their fries clean and use a great breading recipe,  try it you'll be back for more.

The beef is ok, sometimes a little salty.  

mixers,
not the biggest fan but they hit the spot when you need to.  be creative and make your own mixer.  

Service,
well its ok, they do bring it to your table and when you do a drive thru don't expect this to be Wendy's, it will take some time depending on what you order.  Your given a number and a nice high school student will bring some food to you.
The service seems to be young here, they just like hiring someone looking for their 1st job or so.  No this does not create the best service but creates, our local future.  giving a younger kid a job is not easy to do and these kids will move onto another job and keep working this is good karma for Culver's Phoenix  and shows an investment in the town.  

I choose to review this location because it has been around.  I used to go out of my way to find a Culver's.  now they are popping up around town.  As a Midwest person this is great to see.  This is mid west food, comforting a little greasy but dedicated to a great meal.

They had red buckets of Sanitizer sitting on the food preparation counter.  While I like to see a clean restaurant, I don't think keeping a bucket full of cleaners within a couple inches of the food preparation area is wise.  Also the staff was spraying window cleaner on fixtures they were removed for cleaning. This again is a nice thing to see, but not when the overspray was going straight into the food.

Maybe a one time bad experience, but it just looked like some serious lack of supervision of the staff.",2011-08-16

7765,3612,5272,"My sister recently took her '98 VW New Beetle to First Class Auto in Scottsdale, AZ for an overheating issue.  I'm normally the one who does the maintenance on the vehicle but I was ~600 miles away.  She described the symptoms as follows: overheating light came on while she was stuck in construction traffic and went back off once she was moving again.  I immediately suggested that the radiator fans may not be coming on for some reason.  Since I wasn't around to look at it, she took it to First Class Auto.

She relayed the symptoms to the guys at First Class and also SPECIFICALLY requested they check  radiator fan functionality.

They told her the water pump was cracked and leaking, needed a new thermostat and also replace the timing belt and serpentine belt while they were in there (water pump is driven by the timing belt on this engine--2.0L 8V 4 cyl AEG code).  Well, a) I personally replaced the timing belt, water pump and serpentine belt about 10,000 miles ago as preventative maintenance.  What's more is the car hasn't lost any coolant since the job.  So the water pump being cracked is highly unlikely!  I did not replace the thermostat, though.  Once she called me to tell me this, I told her to decline the work and either take it somewhere else or wait for me to make a trip out.

I had a job to do that brought me almost half way to the Phoenix area so I decided I would make the trip the rest of the way to have a look for myself yesterday.  FIRST thing I did was check the radiator fans.  I turned on the AC and the fans didn't come on at all.  I pop the cover off the strip fuse panel that resides on top of the battery and found a melted 30 AMP fuse.  Guess what that fuse is for?  The RADIATOR FANS!  Imagine that.  Being a car that lived most of its life in Michigan, some of the fuses and the fuse panel itself had become corroded and caused the one fuse and part of the fuse panel to melt.  The coolant level was exactly at the max level, right where it was after I did the maintenance on it 10,000 miles ago, not to mention I checked it before her recent trip to Scottsdale (didn't have to add anything.  The car doesn't leak a drop of coolant).

Local dealer had a new fuse panel in stock, I swapped it out and replaced all 3 of the 30 amp blade fuses as they were all corroded pretty badly.  The larger strip fuses were still decent.  The radiator fans now work as normal and the car does not overheat.  The hose coming off the thermostat also becomes pressurized and hot at the correct temperature as well, so that's definitely not a problem!  Fans also come on automatically once the coolant temp hits 99 deg Celsius like they're supposed to.  Problem solved!

I drove down to First Class Auto today to give them a chance to explain/defend themselves, but there was only one guy working in the shop who she didn't recognize and no one at the counter.  What great customer service!

So she COULD have spent the quoted $800 and STILL had the same problem!  She just got dinged for a ~$40 diagnostic fee... for an incorrect diagnosis.",2011-03-08

6162,2143,4361,"Took the family to the recent opening of this local Logan's Roadhouse to check it out and maybe find a new local 'gem'. 
Initial impressions were that Logan's is an imitation of one of my favorite family steakhouses, Texas Roadhouse. We go there every chance we can and have never been disappointed in the quality of food or service. 
Anyway back to Logan's, atmosphere was 'okay' (again a wannabe Texas Roadhouse but not quite right), service was fine, but once the food came, that 'sealed the deal' - very disappointing. Not that it was bad or anything, but the quality of the steaks just wasn't anywhere close to what you get at Texas Roadhouse, and when the prices are about the same, well, there's just no sense wasting time or money here. You might think I'm being rough but when all 3 of my kids (ages 7-11) say that they like Texas better, that's gotta say something (they usually never say anything bad - they usually just eat whats in front of them!)

395,356,156,"I have had it with the meat department at Whole Foods Market on Scottsdale Rd & the Mayo Blvd. They really suck.

I gave them another chance (out of desperation really) and they blew it!  I am so disappointed.  I purchased some turkey breasts there (3 of them) at around $30.00 for a 4 lb breast. I came home, froze two and cooked one. It smelled, but my husband insisted that it was the smoked smell of being in the butcher case with all the other meats.

I trusted his opinion and cooked it. Upon slicing it up for dinner, I found that the free range turkey was very fatty. It was gross but no one got sick luckily.

Well, now I just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse. It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is. It is definitely bad.

And it gets even worse! As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts (Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one), I pulled out about 8 inches of thick, fatty, I don't even know what from it. Let's just say it definitely LOOKS like the dead animal it is too. What ever that stuff is, it is all gray and rotten.

They are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money. I have had it with them! 

I am not surprised. They have always been trouble. Frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food. His is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty ""I don't care"" attitude.

I spent over $100.00 there on Turkey (ground & whole) and he (Frank) still charged me for the breast bones - and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash!

The meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted. The manager there cannot be trusted and has failed every time. It is really gross; top dollar for top trash! My husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the ""questionable meat"" instead of throwing it out!  

I am still nauseous from the smell, sight and from touching all that gray, rotting gross stuff. BLEECH!!! I think I ate that in the last one!",2009-07-19

4088,1127,890,"Food? Awesome. Service? Sufficient. Layout? Not the best.

We stopped into Chompie's this past Friday morning on our way out of town for the long weekend. My husband and I have this obsession with breakfast bagels - in particular, breakfast bagels from one amazing joint that makes the absolute best breakfast bagel EVER in our college's hometown. We are always searching for a place as good as Bodo's...well, even 3/4 as good as Bodo's would do...and we never find it. Bodo's is about the most efficient bagel store on Earth (literally the line of 40-50 people is serviced in 10 minutes) and cheap, too!

So, we decided to give Chompie's a whirl. I don't love the location - like everything else in Arizona, it is tucked into a strip mall. However, there was enough parking and we found it just fine. When you walk in, you're a bit confused as to where to go. Then you realize if you want to eat a full service sit down meal, head to the left - we didn't want to do this, but the food that I was eyeing from afar looked good. To the right is their bakery, which has some pretty appetizing cakes, cookies and desserts. Then there is this counter where you deduce that you order ""to go"" meals. We were overwhelmed by the menu but managed to pull ourselves together in time to order. We both had that initial panic attack of ""oh crap, I have never been here and the menu is longer than a 5 year old's Christmas list and I don't even know where to start because suddenly I feel like I can't even read English."" Deep breath. It's not actually that overwhelming, just a tad unorganized. After ordering, we were instructed to walk all the way across the bakery to a random counter to pay. It was so random the way they had it set up, but we did as we were told and then we waited.

My husband's sandwich took a while to make....again, I don't know how Bodo's does it, but Chompie's is probably 4 times slower. Or is it more appropriate to say that Bodo's is 4 times as fast? Whatever. Either way, Bodo's has the breakfast bagel process down perfectly. Waiting was fine, though...we weren't in a rush. When my husband's warm sandwich was finally ready, we got our stuff and then headed outside (there is nowhere to eat inside if you don't want to have a full service meal, which is one complaint I would make about this place). Who wants to eat their bagel outside when it's pushing 110 degrees? Not me. Even if I am under a strip mall canopy that provides some shade.

Anyway, his sandwich was actually really tasty - warm and fresh and really yummy. My bagel was not toasted, which I had requested, which was slightly annoying. However, the bagel itself was very good. We will definitely be back for the food, and I totally recommend this place for grabbing some freshly baked bagels or desserts or whatever. They do have a deli counter as well (meats, cheese, etc). Our breakfast was less than $8 without drinks - fair enough.

I just wish that the layout were a little better and that it was more efficient. I also wish I could have eaten inside. Next time we will likely just do the full service thing.

In the end, it seems that nothing will ever compare to our beloved Bodo's in Charlottesville, Virginia.",2007-09-02

(Um, also guilty...)

But I way digress! Streets like this also always have a couple more decorous dining establishments for when the parental units are in town -- which is exactly what I happen to have stumbled upon in this place, and perfect because if there's anything I love as much as edgy ""hippie chic,"" it's decorum.

7320,1065,645,"If you're in the mood for a foodie adventure, I've got just the thing. A trip to the Caribbean! Head on over to Tempe and enter A Taste of the Caribbean restaurant. The bright yellow and green walls, red floor and outdoor furniture will make you feel like you've arrived. It's kind of scruffy and laid back - this is not the place to come for a quick bite. First of all, you have to make the tough decision about what to order. Oxtails or goat? Jerk chicken, of course, or do you want the milder brown stew chicken? Fish? There's snapper, tilapia, and shrimp. The menu is divided up into Caribbean Favorites, Friday and Saturday Menu, Lunch Specials, Rice Bowl Specials and Plate Specials. If all this has your head spinning, you're not alone. Our server, part of the family who own and run the place, seemed equally confused. But she was charming. Just accept it, and the slow service as part of the experience - don't worry, be happy.

     We ordered oxtails ($11.95) and Eggplant Curry Shrimp ($9.95). The oxtails, in a brown sauce, were fall-off-the-bone tender, fatty, as oxtails are, and totally delicious. The accompanying plantains were caramelized and a little crunchy. Perfection. A huge mound of rice and peas filled the center of the plate - moist and beautifully seasoned. And finally, a side of cabbage. There must have been a little sugar in the cooking pan, because it was sinfully delicious. Served on the side was a basket of roti, a homemade flatbread, similar to a flour tortilla but much softer. It was so hot we burned our fingers trying to pull off a piece. We had finished off the oxtails when the eggplant dish arrived (they were supposed to have come out together - it's a good thing we like to share). Be forewarned, this curry is not for the faint-of-mouth. I wasn't expecting the degree of heat - my nose started running and my eyes watered. But it was pure bliss, with flavor layered on flavor. The shrimp were perfectly cooked, although I wouldn't have minded a few more, and the eggplant was so tender it was almost melting into the gravy. There were also some pieces of potato, which had not been mentioned on the menu, hiding in there. The heap of rice and peas helped mitigate some of the heat. As you might have gathered, between the roti, the plantains, the rice and peas,and the potatoes, this is a carb-lovers paradise.

     Two odd things: a wide variety of Caribbean sodas are sold here, but no ice tea. And the rest rooms are in a different building than the restaurant.

     The only disappointment was dessert. I got a pineapple tart to take home (I couldn't have eaten another carb if my life depended on it). Our server had said it was the best of the two desserts available. Uh-oh. The tart was really bad - a smidgen of decent pineapple filling wedged between layers of leaden dough, tough and greasy.

Not terribly difficult you keep your eyes peeled, Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona and is a must try for any Phoenix local. 

You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, although their seafood offerings are my least favorites. I am in love with their conchita pibil, which is their slow-roasted pork and they have the best made-at-the-table guacamole in all of Phoenix. Their food is the kind of special occasion dinner that you and all your guests will be savoring every morsel, but save room for one of their delectable desserts! I'm a fan of their flan, in particular. 

Service is spot on and it's usually pretty packed, so come as early as you can or face a semi-long wait at the bar. Don't worry though, they've got great margaritas. This is the place Tempe's Mucho Gusto wished it could be some day. But it probably won't.",2010-10-27
5264,10,206,"Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.

After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the ""OPEN"" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected ""Butai"").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said ""We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two..."" and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...  

When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.  

I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.  

Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning.",2012-04-28
569,490,527,"I really liked the experience I had at Marcellino's on Friday night.  They had opera singers from the Phoenix Symphony performing which were very good.  I enjoyed my handmade ravioli with spinach and yummy cheese (not fish yay!) filling and the wine and the mouse.  It was good!! 

But then something happened....my date gave the server his card to pay for the meal and it was brought back as not able to be processed (yikes!).  The server also informed him that they'd been able to process someone else's but one other didn't go through.  My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, but had just enough cash to cover the tab, not really enough for a tip.  So he asked the server if they would try to put a lesser amount on the card to cover the tip and take the cash.  This is when the server informed us that the machine might be down and it wasn't just his it was everyone's! So he kinda lied earlier, which wasn't cool.  We then waited another 30 minutes without an appearance by the server to explain what was going on, although I could see Marcellino working on the machine, even trying his own card.  My date got up to go speak with him, and the server tried to divert him, but he was respectful and wanted to speak with the owner.  No attempt was made to really apologize for the delay or make up for the wait...so they wrote down his information and address to mail him a receipt.

Then, the next day, he checked his account and he'd been charged twice!! :( sad, because I thought I might like to go back at some point.",2009-10-19

3550,1059,1219,"This place is a hoot! A friend wanted to go to a movie that had been out for a while and it turned out that it was only still playing at this theater and one other. 

This is typically a $3 theater, we happened to go on a Tuesday and it turns out they have $2 Tuesday so it was even cheaper. You definitely get what you pay for...this theater has been around for a while but it's a great deal compared to the average movie gong cost. The concessions are also reasonable cost. Not the most comfortable seats in the world but you get what you pay for.

The reason this place is a hoot? There are crazy decorations, life size figurines, games, etc, everywhere. I am sure I only really saw about a third of the decorations because it is just sensory overload. I hear they really deck it out at Christmas.

The cosmos and appletinis were $4 and the sake bombs (with Kirin or Sapporo) were $5 and numerous rolls were $5 each; how do you beat that? 

The food was spectacular. We ordered off of the regular menu (2 orders or tuna tataki, 2 orders of heart attacks, and a dragon roll) and the happy hour menu (crispy spicy tuna, philadelphia roll, calamari roll, shrimp tempura roll and a couple of others that I can't seem to remember).

5009,1690,3688,"I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and that's how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesn't mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal!


They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they weren't ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they don't look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it. 


So far I've had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasn't as creamy than I'm used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but it's a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on. 


I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool). 


Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that I'm not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. It's just so good!

2452,198,1761,"This may be fiction.  I don't know for sure.  Here's what I pretty much think happened.

The other night I was at a bar.  two days later I heard that it was Turf.  So I'm gonna go with it.  In body I was there, however my mind was suffering under an oppressive weight called alcohol that blurred pretty much every little thing that happened.

For example: did I really find myself screaming piano man at the top of my lungs, to rapturous applause from the rest of the bar?  every time I tried to stop, I was goaded forth into the next verse?  (did the piano indeed sound like a carnival?)

Was I really and truly told assuredly that I was gay?  Did I really have an argument for what felt like hours with a fair-eyed girl who has severe trust issues and one fucked up gaydar?  despite the wedding ring and total pudgy married-guy look did I still come across as gay?  (my wife tells me that it can only be the broadway rendition of a billy joel song.  I begrudgingly concede)

Did I really hear someone who claimed to be a teacher misrepresent the very definition of a parallelogram?  Did she really say that a parallelogram could not have right angles?  Did I really scoff right at her and throw down the argument-crushing example of the square (QED biatch!)?  Evidently I did, because I do remember her backing me into a corner and beating my ass with a relentless barrage of haymakers, both rights and lefts, that left me bruised like a second-rate (albeit mathematically-savvy) prizefighter the next day.  Her-110 lbs at the very most, me twice that and then some on the most gravitationally-forgiving day, and I had no response but to cower in my own fucked-up rendition of the rope-a-dope.

Her: ""flex your stomach so I can hit you.""
Me: ""Are you joking?  that's me, flexing.""  (#fat)

so I can tell you little to nothing about turf--I genuinely can't say for sure if that was the place we were at.  But since I asked right when I got there if I was allowed to yell, and the bartender said yes, yell to your heart's delight! I have to say four stars.

I live nearby, and am sad to see that a coffeeshop that sells coffee this horrible is still in business in my neighborhood.

Not only was the breve mocha that I ordered disgusting, so was the process of watching the barista make my drink.

They use hershey's chocolate from a dirty nacho cheese style pump with chocolate sauce dripping down the sides, and coagulated into a thick cap at the tip of the nozzle.  *Disgusting.  

The espresso shot was made without care, or concern for the fact that it was done way too quickly, and with espresso grounds that were ground way before I walked in the door.  Possibly way before the barista started her shift.   *Gross

And finally.  The milk.  She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand.  This was a huge red flag.  Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.  Well, both were accomplished. 

The steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.  And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use. 
Which is FREAKIN - DISGUSTING.

I wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha, and threw it away after taking a sip.  

Hundreds of businesses in the area close down every year, and there are more realty signs in strip malls in this neighborhood than actual storefronts.  AND I really don't understand why this place hasn't joined the many defunct businesses and starry eyed entrepreneurs in the unemployment line.  

If you own a coffeeshop.  Coffee should be your passion.  
If you own a bait shop.  Fishing should be your passion.

I have now been three times (can you blame a gal for craving a burger?) and each time everyone is almost too overfriendly. They ask if you have been in before and if you state no, they offer to go over the menu. Now this might stop after this location has been open longer, but it's helpful since there are only a few locations in the valley. When your order is ready, you are paged and you go up to grab your meal, and they always find it necessary to read back your order, when right in your hand is a tray with a juicy burger begging you to take a bite... so I am always a little feisty for them to read it off, since I want to chow down! They also seem to want to check in on you while you are eating, which is nice... but can be overwhelming if you are on your lunch break and trying to catch up with a friend... but I won't complain about good ol' polite customer service. 

I order their original char burger without cheese and without the onions (I did try them with the onions and honestly, I liked the taste of the burger better without)

I like their crispy onion rings, they seem healthy if that is even possible for an onion ring... but they are crispy and not greasy. Try them, you'll understand what I am saying better :)

The only difference I noticed is they are big on green chile and use black beans instead of refried beans. I have a lot of friends from New Mexico and they all love this restaurant. The food here is delicious and flavorful if you don't live in the neighborhood it's definitely worth the drive.,2009-12-31
6910,557,4798,"Great spot, but it get's wayyyy too packed! Sort of a double edged sword, if it weren't always so packed it probably wouldn't be such a hotspot, but being so packed makes me decide to not go there about 60% of the time it crosses my mind.

My advice, if you are gonna go, go early and lock down a good location...",2011-08-01
3872,2318,910,"We decided to meet friends here Saturday night.  Cant vouch for the drinks because I wasn't feeling well that day and decided that drinking wouldnt help things.  My wife got pretty happy with some Red Bull and vodka's, yuck, but whatever floats your boat.

Wendy... well lets just say she's not going to be drinking Long Island Iced Teas for a while!  But I'm thinking they were pretty good, cuz 4 drinks pretty much says ""i like these"" or ""i cant taste anything anymore"".

Music was good, dancing was hilarious and fun - as is always the case with K and C.  I would go back, I enjoyed the atmosphere... Um... minus a few wanna be porn stars LOL.... but hey, like I said, whatever floats your boat!  Good for a laugh at least!",2009-04-27

3664,493,2826,"I've been here four or five times and never been too impressed. The atmosphere, art installations and eclectic seating gave me high hopes. The location is also unbeatable, walking distance from my place. But the service has always been sub-par, like it's a bother to take my order and converse with me.  Everyone here, including most of the clientele, seem way too cool for school.  The iced tea, my usual, is good; the iced coffee is great-tons of flavor and plenty of body. Espresso drinks are pretty standard for your indie coffee shop. I've asked for their vegan pastry (which changes daily) three times only to be told that they ran out for the day. I know that this happens, and I love that they freshly bake their goodies everyday and have a rotating menu, but I would also like to try the vegan scone sometime please.

Today, I ordered a strawberry-raspberry-cranberry smoothie ($5 for a small!) and confirmed with the boy behind the counter that the smoothies are vegan/non-dairy. He said yes then informed me that they use Naked juices for the base then just add fruit and ice. (Naked juice! So that's where the $5 price tag comes from!) Three minutes later, I was handed a delicious looking smoothie topped with...whipped cream...?

8721,270,3190,"Move over Maizie's you've been replaced...for brunch that is. I have a tradition with a lucky few of at least once a weekend going to Maizie's for their brunch and getting smashed. Oh, and we eat a little too.

Everything changed this weekend though when we went to Postino on Central for their brunch debut. The food was so ridiculous good, that we actually forgot to drink. Did you hear me?? FORGOT TO DRINK!!

Since it was our first time there, we ordered a variety of options. I had the Country Toast, which was toasted MJ Bread, topped with Italian Ham, Gruyere Cheese, and a sunny-side up egg. Ho-ly shit. Each bite became increasingly better than the last. It was the perfect bite over and over and over again. The ham had a nice little spice to it, the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it, the egg was, well, an egg, and the toast really brought it all together incredibly. And it was huge. I barely got through half if it before I had to give up.

My brunch date got Postino's take on French Toast. To be honest, I am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning, however I would have bathed in this french toast. It was creamy, not overly sweet, and literally melted in my mouth.

I ordered a White Peach Bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute, I completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal. Me. Ignoring anything in a champagne flute. I know.

I feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy, but I'm sorry Maizie's, consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out!",2009-12-08
8737,578,3456,"Home to the Mariners and Padres Spring Facilities, Peoria Sports Complex is a pretty great place to take in the action. I have seen a decent number of games here over the years. Most recently I saw a weekend game sitting out on the lawn. It does not get much better than relaxing on the lawn, watching some baseball, hanging out with your friends, and getting some color in the 80 degree heat. 

The practical details: (1) there are a TON of food options. Maybe too many, if you believe in such a thing. Food of all kinds is everywhere. You can get all the standard ball park fare and some more exotic things, too, like noodle dishes, sushi, fry bread, etc. (2) Ticket prices are good - sit up close for 20 bucks on down to the lawn for 6 bucks. You can't beat it for getting up close to the action (3) Parking is only 5 bucks in the lot, which I think is really decent, but if you want to walk a little further you could find street parking across the street.

BEST DEAL IN THE PARK: $9 for a 32oz. soda with unlimited refills. A large one is $5 and not as big, so if you get even two this is a great deal. On the hot day I was there we filled the sucker up three times and once more before we left. Well worth it.

In short, if you're doing the Spring Training thing definitely come to Peoria. It's super relaxed and one of the best places to enjoy some baseball. You will want to keep coming back!",2011-03-14

This restaurant is within walking distance from my work and when I have gone for lunch, I have never had to wait. The host is professional and poised. Unfortunately, the hostesses are not as much. But again, you can quickly look past that. The menu has already changed at least a couple of times which makes the dining even more fulfilling because you can keep trying new things! The food is definitely not average or casual cafe style, yet you can find things on the menu such as homemade chips, baked macaroni and cheese and a buffalo sloppy joe. The bar is beautiful and they have live jazz on Saturday nights.Great for a business lunch, a romantic dinner or tasteful happy hour.",2012-07-29

There are a couple bars to sit at and they even open a big door to a bar for the outside too.  They have some good brews on tap and have flat screen tv's as well.  

I have only had a burger and fries here.  They burger was really good, the fries were really greasy and were just okay.

Get there early for 2-for-1 martinis - they have a ton to choose from, if you're a frilly martini drinker - but also make a mean dirty martini with olives, which is my own personal indulgence. 

Multiple rooms for multiple scenes - a dance floor, a more chill bar room and an outdoor loungey space - so whatever you're looking for you can find it here. Just make sure you've got cab cash to get home - three of these martinis can definitely get the best of you!",2010-07-05

206,193,193,"On one of my many visits to see mi amore, he took me to this fantastic little pizza joint. The aesthetics of the place were overwhelmingly perfect. I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45, yes folks, 45. So the 2 1/2 hour wait was expected, and very VERY worth it. The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven. The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut, either. You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella, slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage, pepperoni slices, salami slices, arugula, fresh basil leaves, tomatoes, etc. Basically what Im getting at, is this is beyond words delicious, classic LEGIT Italian pizza. Around the dining area, you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread, that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated. The smell in that place is heavenly.....incredibly reminiscent of my grandmothers kitchen!!

They have multiple things going on all times of the year, from guided bird watching to night-time observatory star gazing. The preserve is a little sanctuary of nature and beauty within the confines of our sprawling metropolis and I absolutely love it. 

What I especially enjoy is how the Gilbert Public Library looks out to the preserve with its giant floor-to-ceiling windows. So even when it's sweltering in the dead of summer, you can still go to the preserve and enjoy the beauty while reading a book in the library.",2009-04-24

I've used Janice for awhile now when she was at Fido's on Bell Road and followed her to this location.   The location is right next to Subway and is a hole in the wall by all means!  They have two groomers from what I can tell, Jennifer is the other one and my bf's dog has been groomed by her and she did a great job too.    

Why did I follow my groomer to this new place?  Well 1. Fidos Closed and 2. So many places just shave the dogs down, but Janice really takes the time to get to know what you want and takes good notes so when you come back she knows exactally what to do.

5 years in the owner is nice to me, but still doesn't know my name.  I go there 10 times a year minimum - so it shouldn't be that hard to at least RECOGNIZE me.

I decided to have my wedding dress altered there this year because I knew and trusted her.  She made a big to do about my dress and my wedding, but when I stopped by with my ENTIRE wedding party to pick up ALL of our dresses, she had no idea what we were talking about.  ""Dress?  What type of dress?""  

Uh, my WEDDING dress?  The only one in the store?  Hanging right there?

Every pair of pants she has hemmed for me - from jeans to slacks - has been too short, by over an inch, and she charged me SIX dollars to sew a button back on... when I brought her the button.

Went with my best friend last night for our weekly date and had a great meal!  We enjoyed the sushi menu but everything looked quite delicious.  I LOVED the welcoming sushi chefs and beautiful aquariums.  Here is a rundown of the food...

Edamame: solid...can't really screw that one up
Philly: Great distribution of cream cheese!  I hate when sushi places over do it on the Philly...
California: Solid but could have been a bit creamer and with some spicy sauce 
Some kind of Latino roll: Skip it...weird texture inside
Scallop roll: Yummm

I've probably eaten at MBFGR five or seven times, and the only time I had a problem was on my last visit, where they served me a plate with cold fries.  This was a mistake, as I had a slight hangover and really, really wanted my gyros pita and fries that day, so I asked for fresh fries.  Well, whether it was to apologize or to be sassy I can't say, but either way, I ended up receiving the biggest fattest plate of fresh, hot fries I've ever seen.

The staff were really nice and the building is really cool, but my coffee was more of a milk shake than any sort of blended coffee - I even asked to make sure it was made with coffee. It had no coffee flavour at all and certainly wasn't ""double chocolate"". I loved all their different seating, the vintage cash register and even one of the coolest bathrooms I've ever been in, but if I'm going to pay nearly $5 for a 16oz drink, I want it to taste amazing. Was also disappointed that they didn't have any real selection in the bakery case - it was all sandwiches, breads, and a tarte (which looked good but was also overpriced).

My boyfriend and I are always looking for new places to try and came upon this place on Yelp when our regular Saturday spot decided to no longer be opened for lunch Saturdays. Right upon entering we were greeted by someone behind the register and he sat us down at a booth. The decor was great and the place was spotless. We ordered the Saturday special of Monte Cristo, the potatoes and the biscuits and gravy among other items. The Monte Cristo was perfection and the home made blueberry and strawberry jam was excellent! The potatoes were seasoned to perfection and eggs cooked perfectly.

They have a good selection of beer on draft and bottle.  I had a New Belgium Super IPA that they had on draft and one of their sausages(Chicken and Apple) topped with some sauerkraut and mustard.  It was quite a good combination and was recommended by our server.

If you're looking for food, then you may be disappointed in the small amount of options, however, when you realize that their kitchen is the size of a small closet, it kind of makes sense. 

With the cooler weather right on the horizon here in the valley, their very large patio area should come in quite handy.

I will definitely try them out again.",2012-10-10
6761,214,1541,"Coming into the Phoenix area for a family party, we stopped off at Los Sombreros for some margaritas and Mexican on an otherwise cooler night in the valley of the sun. 

I was told they are very picky about reservations and, if your party isn't complete, no table. So our 6pm reservation was now in jeopardy because the last two of us (me and my fiance) were running late due to issues on the ramp at Sky Harbor airport, obviously out of our control. But they still didn't want to seat us...  additionally, I overhead on the way to the place that they would only ""try"" to do their best to accommodate our party, making it sound like they were booked up solid until closing....typical Scottsdale always trying to look more happening and hot than it really is. 

Moving on, we somehow ""lucked out"" (go figure) and had a table no problem, so all the stress caused by the hostess was unnecessary and, in my opinion, pretty unprofessional, especially since the restaurant was empty by 8pm, again, typical Scottsdale. 

The menu was brief, and I almost had to double check I wasn't looking at an appetizer. Most of the items are typical Mexican staples with a bit of a Southwestern American twist to them making the food a hit or miss if you ask me, some items were good, some were not. But that's really anywhere I suppose. 

The one thing that stood out for me was the Guac. I will say this was flat out delicious but Guac is pretty had to screw up. 

The margaritas in my opinion reminded me of something you'd get more at Chilis, a little too sweet for my liking but definitely drinkable. 

The fundidto appetizer we ordered left the table empty twice and well I'm not really one to combine seafood and cheese, this blend seemed to have a harmony with others and I'd recommend it to a first timer, +1 if you request to add spinach. 

Finally moving on to the entrees, different contraptions from the kitchen filled our table with vibrant colors, assortments and sizes. 

I myself ordered what I was told is sort of the house specialty ,call it carnitas mixed in a chipotle sauce with veggies type of deal. While it was tasteful and was more than enough to get the job done for me, the flavor of the pork wasn't really there, at, all. 

I browsed over a couple other reviews and noted the same complaint but hey that's what hot sauce is for I guess. 

Overall it's an alternative to the chains hoarding Scottsdale road.",2010-10-23
5782,202,4139,"Just when I'm about to give up on my search for good Thai around Glendale, I stumble upon a true diamond in the rough. Don't be fooled by the shabby looks of the outside plaza; the inside is contrarily well orchestrated with subtle Thai ornaments and design. A huge desk in the lobby and bigger one inside the dining hall gives this establishment an odd but distinct hotel feel. Much like that feeling, the service is intriguingly exceptional from the time you walk into the front door. 

The food that I've tried here so far is... may I say it... divine. I started off with the squid salad with mint and lemongrass and it was packed with fish sauce and shrimp paste. Score. I also tried some papaya salad and once again, it was mounded in fish sauce and chili. Splendid. Then I had the minced beef phad kaprow (which is not on the menu) and lo and behold, I was tasting Phuket in a Bangkok sort of way. To be honest... the sauces from each of these entrees mingle quite well. You can drizzle some of each dripping over rice and literally have an orgy in your mouth of Mormonic proportions. You can also bolster it with some more heat with their chili fish sauce, again drizzled all over your concoction. Let your adventurous mind roam free and order something outside the pad thai genre. It will pay off handsomely.",2009-09-20

1. Great deals on contact lenses. Before I would buy my contacts from justlenses.com but through Costco I bought 8 boxes (a year's supply) and received $50 off! $25 off via instant rebate at the cashier and another $25 off via mail-in rebate which came in less than a month after the order.

2. PIZZA AND HOT DOGS. The take out pizza is huge and only 9.99 and the hot dog and coke pair is only 1.50. These make for a delicious and quick lunch. They also have smoothies and salads if you're looking for something on the ""lighter"" side.

3. Food expos come and go often. Recently I got a deal on a 10 pack of pita bread, a huge container of hummus and pita chips for 12 bucks. The company was from California and let customers try as many samples as they pleased.  It was well worth the money and super fresh!

4. And here's where I feel Costco has really benefited me. My fiance and I booked our honeymoon to Tahiti through Costo Travel! I'm big on comparing prices before making a big purchase and Costco was hands down the best price. It included seven nights, hotel and round-trip airfare all for one great deal.

The place does get a little cramped during meal times, but we used to take ours to go and sit in the park after a bike ride down Central and picnic away and then do our best to ride it off afterwards so we weren't wallowing in the guilt of our deep fried pleasures.

3210,1615,2526,"I'm not generally a fan of restaurants located within a mall, especially if it's a chain restaurant. I just don't care for the mall dining atmosphere. However, Kona Grill really surprised me! Especially the seafood. For a restaurant located in a mall... in Arizona... the seafood was awesome.

There are 3 important things you need to know about Kona Grill:

1. The Sea Bass is melt in your mouth, oh my god, foodgasm, amazing. Our waiter recommended it to us and I was highly skeptical. I thought that he was pushing this dish just because it's the most expensive one on the menu. Well, aside from the fact that it's the priciest item at a chain restaurant, it tastes more like a 5 star dish that would cost double the amount somewhere else. I'm telling you, YOU MUST TRY IT! It has this pan seared taste that is to die for. (I also can't forget to mention that the Salmon is super tasty as well).

2. The Cool Cucumber Mojito is not only refreshing and delicious, but it is also less than 100 calories! It's pretty strong too. This drink is pure heaven for a mojito lover like me, and it gets extra bonus points since its low calorie!  

3. Happy hour!!! It's the best and it's always packed. Kona Grill has great deals with always changing specials (I suggest checking their website before heading over).

Just try at least one of these 3 things and you'll see why I'm such a fan of this place. Overall, when it comes to dining at Fashion Square Mall, Kona Grill is pretty impressive.",2010-11-30

Since I didn't know anyone yet I went by myself and sat at the bar. The staff was friendly and so were the patrons. Some of the patrons turned out to be a little too friendly, and the bartender, Jennifer, insisted that the barback walk me to my car to ensure my safety. As if that wasn't enough to make a fan out of me, I found out they serve $2 Blue Moons all day Saturday and the food is awesome!

The burgers are great, and you can order them rare if you like. I also became addicted to their BBQ chicken sandwich. And the wings. They'll grill them instead of fry them for you which is a bonus. In fact I don't thing there is anything that I have tried and disliked here.

Thursday-Sunday night they usually have a pretty decent cover band. Usually classic rock or 80s stuff. They also have NTN and a ton of TVs if you're into sports.

I was so in love that when it came time to move from my apartment, I made sure my new house was within walking distance. Not that you'd need to walk, (since half the year it is hot as hell even at 2am I can see why you wouldn't want to walk) they offer a free ride program on the weekends where they'll pick you up and drop you off. That way you don't have to worry about Sheriff Joe and wearing pink undies at Tent City.

Wow, I kinda wanna move back now. CK's I miss you!!!",2009-07-30

I love the decor, it's fun to hang out here and have drinks at night. I've also had breakfast here before too, it was pretty good and certainly a different feel from the saucy evening there before, but it still had the same effect on me, that I was ab-fab.

It was pretty unorganized though and I am sure that it is due to people moving books to where they shouldn't be and there just being too many books to keep organized.

5181,2814,1834,"While the idea is not new - an updated outdoor shopping center that mimics a European outdoor shopping and residential district, Kierland Commons is similar to West Village in Dallas, TX or Santana Row in Santa Clara, CA, however, in the Scottsdale version, it is completely stripped of any personality and design, perhaps to better blend in with the desert environment.

The usual suburban chain stores can be found at this shopping center, ranging from Smith and Hawken, Banana Republic, Barnes & Noble and the like, though there are a select few independent retailers which make a trip to this center a little more interesting.  Parking can be difficult, however, there are lots that line the backside of the center as well as valet parking across from the center park.  People watching is quite entertaining, from the kiddies that frolick in the fountains, to Barbie's desert siblings.

The independent dining options are a little more interesting, such as The Green House and Zinc Bistro, though again, the usual unimaginative chains are represented here, including PF Chang's and The Cheesecake Factory.  

While I don't find most of the retail offerings at Kierland Commons to be particularly compelling to make multiple repeat visits, I will return for the more independent dining options.",2008-05-27
256,237,242,"Pupusas?? As a hardcore Mexican food enthusiast I was intrigued by the concept but barely able to figure out how this fascinating dish was pronounced.  I am proud to say that I am a HUGE fan of pupusas now.  

Salvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a low-key, nice Sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food.  It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa.

The restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with.  One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know.  I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans.  She had the chicken as well with carne asada.  This little dish is fantastic!  I think next time I'll just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.)

The only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear.  I'd love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a ""Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!""

On a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible.  I'd love to try the Ceviche, as it's on the Best of Phoenix list, and there are a few other dishes (think breakfast) that looked intriguing.",2010-03-22
7876,422,5331,"Am I missing something here? I've actually been back to America's. Twice after my first visit, convinced that I had accidentally gone to the wrong America's or perhaps stumbled into a nearby taco shop on 7th. 

Alas, the helpful Yelp photo informs me that I have, in fact, now eaten three times at the Famous America's Taco Shop.

I can't emphasize how incredibly average and underwhelming the fare here is. See, I'm a burrito man, myself. I don't claim to know Mexican food or it's various subgenres, but I did live in San Diego for three years and I've definitely had what I would call over-the-top, blow your socks out your a** good Mexican food. The same can be said for any number of burritos. 

America's, I'm sorry to say it, but neither your tacos nor your burritos live up to the incredible hype that now surrounds you (although, the salsa was really, really good).

1296,268,41,"I reeeeaaalllyyyyy wish that I could give this a 4, but I can't do that in good conscience.  The food was great, but the service was downright abysmal.

In a fit of random adventurousness, I thought it would be fun to try a new kind of food for me.  I'm typically a weenie and afraid of anything ""weird"" so this is a big deal for me.  We drove out here on Friday night and at around 6 or so the restaurant was about half full.  We stood at the door for entirely too long while we waited to be seated.  When we were at our table, we waited entirely too long to get menus.  When we knew what we wanted, we waited entirely too long to place our order.  You get the idea.  Thankfully the food came out fairly quickly.  

I ordered the vegetarian plate that had collard greens, some kind of cabbage/carrot/potato thing, red lentils, and some bean/carrot/onion thing.  As with all dishes, it was served with the injera, a weird sourdough crepe thing.  I was a little weirded out that the bread thing was served cold, but I got used to it quickly enough.  Everything on my plate was yummy, but if I were to rank it, my favorite would be the lentils, followed by the collard greens, then the potato, then the carrot/bean thing.  

Eating here was a fun experience for sure, and not having any silverware definitely made for some creative feeding procedures.  I would probably come back here if the mood for Ethiopian food struck me again, but I would really hope that the service would be better.  Since everyone else mentions great service, I am going to assume we came at an ""off"" time.",2010-05-03

5549,2275,4004,"I've been to the Greene House many times. In general, I think it's pretty good. I go mostly for lunch, and I order from the sandwiches & salads typically.Tonight was no different - had a sandwich.

I went with my brother as a belated bday celebration. Ordered the roast beef sandwich with a side salad instead of fries. Had the pineapple rum cake for dessert.

The first few times I ate at the Greene House, I was really impressed. I thought the food and service was very good. Over time, I've become less impressed. Tonight, the service was great - loved my server. Everything worked like a well-oiled machine. Good coordination between the staff, and we were kept well supplied throughout dinner.

The food is not consistent. That's a big issue I have with restaurants in general. Maybe I'm harsh, but I really believe being inconsistent knocks a place down a few notches. The problem with inconsistency is that you don't know what you're going to get. If a place is consistently mediocre, at least I know I'm going to get mediocre.

Tonight the real downer to the whole meal was the salad. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was not great either - bun too big compared to the amount of meat and other filling items on the sandwich, not enough meat - but the side salad was really awful. First, if I moved the salad on my plate, there was a big pool of dressing on my plate. There is such a thing as a properly dressed salad, and this was not it. Way too much dressing. I might have been ok with that had the dressing been very good... which it wasn't. The balsamic dressing was too sweet, and was under seasoned (definitely needed more salt).

The dessert was good. It wasn't great... but it was good. The rum cake, in my opinion, was too dry. Maybe the ridiculously large scoop of gelato is supposed to compensate for that, but I'd prefer a more moist cake and less gelato. I'm also not a huge fan of places where the dessert is almost as big (if not bigger) than the entree. Give me a couple bites of something amazing rather than a huge plate of something mediocre. I felt that this dessert fell into the later category.

I'm going to admit that this is only the second time I've ever had dessert at The Greene House, so I won't pass judgement on it's entire dessert menu, but I'll say the couple times I've been there, the dessert/entree ratio was way out of whack for my liking.",2009-09-10

On July 7, 2011, my date  and I arrived around 6:30 pm, well dressed and ready to enjoy a celebratory dinner without any financial limitations. We would have easily spent $250+.

Instead, after an hour of being seated  to review our menus we were never offered more than a cocktail.

Tables around us were receiving quality attention by other servers...complete with the run down of the specials, house favorites, answering questions, etc. We, on the other hand, were lucky to have our make server look at us, much less take us to the next step our level in our dining experience.

When the table behind us, seated a good 15 mins after us, received bread before we were, my date and I decided that was our tipping point and would not stay any longer.

When our server came to ask if we were ready to order we informed him  we would not be staying for dinner  and would like the bill for the cocktail.

Never once did the server apologize, offer what he could do to make things right, etc. 

Needless to say, we were stunned. The hostess thanked us for dining on our way out...again, we both gritted our teeth with frustration. However, later we discovered that after an hour of sitting in the dining room, we were there long enough to enjoy a meal. It's unfortunate we never got the opportunity to, however.

I somehow feel the need to appologize for the lack of stars to all of you who seem to love this place. I would certainly be willing to give it another try but I was not impressed.

First the music is loud, and therefore everyone talking in the place turns up the volume and as my girlfriend and I were seated across from each other at the communal table we could barely reach to share the food let alone hear each other.

Why are the tables so big if the food is so small? Maybe I am a bit of a glutton, but for 8 dollars I essentially ate a mushroom for dinner...Don't get me wrong it was tasty, and I understand Tapas are appetizers, but 8 dollars? I was disapointed. I used to go to Firefly in Vegas and it was cheaper and tastier.

We just wanted to try this place and move on someplace quieter, but I was really looking forward to it...We decided not to have drinks and simply share one thing so we could get to said quieter place before it got too late...I think because we ordered so little, the waitress considered us a waste as far as her tips were concerned and therefore seemed not so friendly...and those little bitty glasses of water they bring...I drank immediately and it was never refilled.

We went here after a soccer game two weeks ago, and I have to say, I thought I was going to be disappointed. I expected greasy food, and grimy scenery. This was not the case, although the scenery was mildly disturbing as most of the decor included some dearly departed wildlife. I had a great sandwich I believe called the healthy choice, that was supposedly was healthy? It came on this great thick toasted buttery whole grain bread, egg whites, hollindase sauce, tomato and avocado. It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I don't think it was a calorie saver by any means but I am sure it was just the idea it was made with healthier ingredients. For a lodge, this was a terrific restaurant, and yes this is a compliment by far, joking aside, as you remember my thoughts of what a lodge was all about. This is nothing like the local VFW. The only other scary part was this jerk at the bar decided to take his shirt off, and throw it across the room. And ladies, no, this was definitely not a pretty sight nor was it funny.

8051,1782,260,"""No.""  

If you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai, that is what I will say. 

0 stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson.  

0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it.

In this case, I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo, and both in Tempe.  The other half was in Tampa, and since he does not care much for Thai, I get the chance to try one.  

The limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM, and connected me with another limo at Broadway. With traffic, getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes.  On exiting the limo, 5:50 PM, I walked back about half a block to the restaurant.

On entering the restaurant, I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me.  He asked me where I wanted to sit, at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table, which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant.  

There are at least 120 seats in this restaurant.  Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door?  You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you?  Then again, your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me.  The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED!

When I was seated, staffperson offered to bring water.  The phone rang and he was off, as he offered another version of ""I am the only staffperson here...""  I looked at the menu and made my decision. In the menu, there is a $2 charge listed for sharing.  This goes against everything Thai I have ever known.  The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served.  Because of my proximity to the fish tank, I was quite up close and personal with the fish. The water probably isn't filthy, but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception. 

6 PM, as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour.  I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order. 6:01, the staffperson comes, bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile.  He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order.  I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom, the Thai name for the green papaya salad. Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items.  The phone rang again.

Staffperson's attention was no longer on me.  The phone, his Pavlovian stimuli, had taken him away.  I asked if he had heard me.  He replied that he needed to go answer the phone.  He asked if I minded waiting, as he was the only staffperson.  I said I would wait.  Off he went, in pursuit of electronic interaction.  

6:10 PM, staffperson returns, apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order.  I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side.  Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen.  The phone rang as he left the table,  his pace quickening as he approached the phone.  

6:18 PM, the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter.  The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons.  

6:20 PM, staffperson returns. He brings the salad and a bowl of rice.  The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not have cucumber, shredded lettuce or cilantro.  On sending back the initial preparation, staffperson returned with the original preparation, advising the chef stated ""This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish"".  I sent the order back, citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation.

6:25 pm.  As I empty my water glass, the salad I received previously is returned, minus the cucumber.  In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original, he replied that he did not know.  I stood and left.  While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have ""The Best Curry in the Valley"",   they will get no second chance to prove it to me.  For all the phone activity, there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order.  Between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson, I have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business.",2012-07-01

On top of that, they offer discounts on other appetizers such as the bread and cheese plate, a GIANT crab cake, a salads, and shrimp dishes.  All are tasty.

So, rather than go to my neighborhood mani/pedi place, we went over to old town scottsdale for lunch and a (we hoped) luxurious pedicure.  This place looked very promising, and the lady at the front really talked them up, so we took the plunge.  

Everything seemed promising . . . we waited in a lovely outdoor area until they were ready for us.  Then . . . disappointment.  The pedicure was nothing I couldn't get for half the price, the massage chairs just vibrated, my feet were still a little rough afterward, and the paint job wasn't even that good.  

Basically, this was VERY overpriced for what was an incredibly unexceptional pedicure.  We still enjoyed ourselves, but agreed we would never go back there.",2010-11-05

You may be curious to know why we haven't been here in so long, well just ONCE we saw a cockroach on the wall that grossed us out, and that's why this place loses a star.

936,191,841,"I have been visiting Mrs. White's going on 30 years, but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken, my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation - I almost got cold feet.

Good thing I didn't. The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.

When you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes. 

I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. I'd just come back on another day. 

To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. White's.

I love this place and hope I always will.",2011-06-25

It's a great place to people watch!  (Don't forget to check out the wine section--not only is the wine random, it's affordable and a great conversation starter with all the cute names and labels)

After moving here from San Diego, I've been so unimpressed by all the breakfast spots in Phoenix.  This is the one place that I LOVE!  I think it offers something for everyone, however my go to is the Venice Beach Burrito.  It's such a casual spot--you order from the counter, find a table, and wait for them to call you to let you know your food is ready to be devoured.  There's tables both inside and out, and you can peruse the store while your stomach rumbles!


The only thing I've ever been disappointed by is the sangria, but then again I'm not a huge fan of white sangria.  I will not be ordering it again but I have girlfriends that love it.

I had never been here for lunch until this past weekend--it was always my late morning brunch spot.  Technically, I believe its a pizza place, but I've never had a pizza.

In my first review, I stated ""the only reason I'm giving it less than 5-stars is because of the noise level.""  As the noise level issue appears to have been rectified, my review is subsequently being modified to reflect this.

Last time I was there I had a salmon salad, which was good though in all honesty the salmon was the star of the dish.  I asked the server to please ask the chef how the salmon was cooked so such perfection.  I honestly did not expect for any type of response.  Lo and behold, a gentleman came out and explained the procedure utilized to get that sear and texture without overcooking or under-cooking the salmon.

Re: Another reviewer's issue with ""soggy fried calamari""
It is tempura calamari, which is different from other ways to fry the calamari.  I have never had any issues with sogginess unless I leave it to sit for too long.  Hmm...  Clearly, they prefer Zinc Bistro.  Honestly, I haven't been to Zinc Bistro so I cannot draw a comparison at this time between the two.

197,184,184,"My girlfriend liked this place more than I did. It may be that I'm spoiled by eating asian food in the Bay Area, but this place just didn't cut it. Unfortunately we both got red curry based dishes, so my experience was fairly limited... I got Duck w/red curry, and was not very impressed at all. The duck was tasty, but the curry was VERY bland. Honestly had I not been told it was curry, I wouldn't really have identified it as curry. The duck came with some plain steamed vegetables on the side, which as the meal went on, served to further water down my already bland curry sauce as the veggie water moved around on the plate. In addition to the curry lacking flavor, the vegetables really needed a boost as well. They should have been stir fried, or been served with a sauce of some sort. 

The service was OK, but not great. There was only one other table in there, and the waitress seemed to forget things, and when we asked her about the meals, I felt like she was giving us canned answers of ""everything is good, just order something so I can go home"". Admittedly it was about 30 or 45 minutes before they closed, so that may have had something to do with it. 

It wasn't a BAD meal by any means. It accomplished the goal of providing nourishment, and was better than bringing mickey D's back to the hotel room, but I won't be going back. The yelp definition of 2 stars is ""Meh. I've experienced better"", and I think that description fits my meal perfectly.",2012-01-13

9080,2009,1914,"My hubby and I have been fans of Roy's since our first time at the flagship location on Oahu . . . and we've watched him expand to the mainland. Our experience with the mainland Roy's have been hit and miss, but the Marriott Desert Ridge location pretty much knocks it out of the park! We went at the tail end of Arizona Restaurant Week. We really liked the menu options for this special week, and the warm chocolate souffle cake is always out of this world . . . If that was the only thing that tasted good, then we would feel we got our money's worth . . . but we didn't have to worry about it because everything was perfect from beginning to end.

We had an adorable server who had a great personality and excellent people skills. She was unassuming and let us linger between courses. As I am a stickler about food coming out too soon after just finishing one course, this was just perfect! And so relaxing. The ambiance on the patio, which is where we chose to sit, almost felt as if we were on one of the islands, not in the middle of the desert . . . with the tiki torches lit and the sound of the babbling water features throughout the resort, it came pretty close . . . it was just missing the trade winds.  The resort had a band playing as well . . . they were pretty good, a few ups and downs. I would have loved if the music was a little more subtle than the pop-jazz mix they were playing . . . oh, but I have digressed. 

My hubby and his daughter chose the restaurant week menu. Hubby had the Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs Smoked & Glazed in Roy's Original Mongolian Sauce. A bit cliche, but they were finger lickin' good! My step-daughter and I shared the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi Beurre Blanc -- it was huge and almost a meal. The rolls were fresh, crunchy, and had a little kick . . . not too spicy. It was a good thing I agreed to help her with it! For entrees, my hubby had the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi with Spicy Soy Mustard Butter Sauce. It, too, was an ample portion of tender ahi that was complimented by the sauce but no overpowered by it. My step-daughter had the Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi with Maine Lobster Essence. Another nice portion of perfectly cooked Mahi.  We all were starting to feel the aloha spirit . . . I had to be the exception by ordering off the regular menu and chose my most favorite entree of all . . . the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish . . . Aah, what a delight, so melt-in-your-mouth delicate . . . I was in island heaven.

Desserts were total home runs -- the melting hot chocolate souffle is mandatory for any chocolate lover. In fact, it tastes the same at every Roy's we've been to . . . it never disappoints. A total surprise . . . and a delightful one . . . was the chocolate coconut cheesecake which came with a side of mango sorbet . . . or did she say it was pineapple sorbet . . . whatever . . . it was the perfect accompaniment to the light and fluffy cheesecake.

We also ordered a bottle of Newton claret which was a modestly priced wine and as my husband said as he swirled and sipped it . . . ""I know my wines . . . "" Having to always be the exception, I ordered the he Original Hawaiian Martini, which was what I considered my dessert. It was a juicy combination of Maui pineapple, vodka and coconut rumMMMMM!

It was truly a beautiful evening from start to finish. You may be asking why I didn't give it five stars then if there were no misfires . . . that five star is reserved for Roy's Hawaiian restaurants that really do create the aloha experience with some special touches only that can only be enjoyed there!",2012-09-23

I really love the mussels in the white sauce here and last time I also had the spinach salad.  It was delicious!  Fresh and served with the perfect amount of bacon vinaigrette.

The service is good, nothing special - but what is with the waitresses wearing flip flops?  I just don't see how that is sanitary especially if they're walking in the kitchen.

They were busy and I was asked to wait a bit...no problem!  The lady that greeted me took a look at my nails, which was a dark red gel manicure, and told me she would start me in a soak.  She asked what color did I want and I replied that I wanted white tips. 30 minutes later the lady that signed in after me was called first then 10 minutes later I was called and told to soak my nails in soapy water bath.  I sat and soaked for 20 minutes while the workers worked on people that walked in with ""quicky"" needs.  Finally, the lady that greeted me came over and said I should have been soaking in acetone and not water...she apologized and started the acetone soak.  30 minutes later, and after I scraped off most of the old polish myself, a man started my manicure and my greeter finished it so the man could start a lady's pedicure who had been soaking her feet for 30 minutes and visibly pissed.  When she was done with me she told me that the next time I come in I need to tell them that I have old gel polish on so I can be started with the correct soak.  Really?
I was relieved to finally get out of there and all ready to pay my $25 for the services.  I was told it would be $25 for the gel manicure AND $5 for the white tips!  Wow!  Really?

Aside from the above, they make great sandwiches, have a nice salad bar, have different take out dinners available every night, have a pasta night and will make you a fantastic iced tea or an iced latte that rivals any chain.  They also have an awesome grill - they will make you a kobe blue cheese burger that is out of this world.  The hot dogs are delicious but they are gigantic (and a little unsettling to look at).

9346,2984,861,"NOTE: Ignore the reviews above. It looks as if there is some deliberate attempt by the Udupai owners to pose as members and bash this place. Yes, this owner used to own Udupai Cafe and Udupai Cafe is another dosa house that competes with this eatery.  If you read my other reviews, you know that I'm critical and  my attention to detail is there so I'm not one of these people who likes every place he eats at.

Positives
I'm Indian and I can assure you this place is good. I have never been to Udupai Cafe but based on its failing health inspections, I would be scared to eat there. Woodlands is a nice CLEAN eatery in a nice part of Chandler.  It's not a restaurant.  It's basically a Dosa shop. They  specialize in Dosa and offer several types. They also have excellent Indian Chinese dishes.   The food is consistently good and I have eaten there on several occassions.  This is a lunch/light dinner place.  Don't think of this place like a restaurant.  There are several types of Dosa and that's what this place specializes in.  The restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so don't worry about failing health codes here...at least not for a while.

Negatives
Their non-South Indian dishes are not so good. For non-Indians, they should be informed that this is a Dosa house so order dosa and other south Indian dishes.  Don't order your typical Indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer (it wasn't good here).   The owner also says every dish is excellent which isn't true; he is kind of a businessman so he doesn't really care about telling you which dishes stand out.  Stick to the Dosa and the Vegetable Manchurian.  Their mango shake wasn't very good. Their chiku shake is great.",2008-09-06

Its not rocket science. Let me walk Sauce through this:
- Cut slices of cheese. Precut is pretty gross.
- Put bread around cheese.
- Apply butter to the outside.
- Grill til melted.

The Lounge had tasty small Tapas which I enjoyed while it drizzled that night, the whole hotel has a great relaxing ambiance.

The nights were amazing to walk around the hotel or sit around the pool with the night lights on and enjoy the peacefulness of the resort.  I believe we saw bats flying around in the middle of the night. which was very cool.

Are you 50 years old and Caucasian?

Then the Golden Buddha is the place for you! 

Its in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. 

For dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting ""real Chinese"" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.

The best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. 

They do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.

Come here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.",2008-11-14

3861,2314,2955,"Rinaldi's Italian Deli is a very good place for lunch if your in this area and looking for something a little lighter than a burger and fries.  They are conveniently located near the corner on Deer Valley and 19th ave, next to Dunkin Donuts.  They are open for breakfast, lunch and an early dinner.  

I recommend going during breakfast or lunch if your interested in their ""Specials of the Day"" that are on their hot plates. These items don't look too appetizing if you go by in the late afternoon or evening. 

They offer homemade soups and fresh cut salads loaded with just about anything you could imagine.  They have a small selection of homemade pasta salads as well.  

I had their pastrami on rye with their spicey, nazzle opening, and horse radishy dressing.  The pastrami was very good but had to be heated in a micro-wave. My sandwich was assembled very well so props to the girl behind the counter!  Their Italian pasta salad was excellent. Their Cob salad was also very good, nothing fancy but a good balance of veggies, bacon, egg, tomato, blue cheese, avocado with grilled chicken.

Had a little snafu with our servers where someone who was not our waiter took our drink orders, but it was straightened out pretty quickly.  We each ordered one of the signature drinks, the wife got cucumber lemonade (I think) and I got a green arnold palmer.  I liked the g.a.p.  For the meal, don't remember what the wife had, I got the chicken sausage pizza.  It was fine, nothing out of the ordinary.  

Basically, that's how the whole meal was, okay, but didn't blow me away (not that I'm a huge healthy/organic foodie kind of guy though).  I guess I'd go here again, but I probably wouldn't suggest it.  (I did think the music was a little loud...)",2009-11-04

8874,1448,5849,"I love love love consignment stores...and walking in this store, the smell was great...  however...

I have to say i am disappointed with My Sister's Closet. I had heard such great things, so I was really excited to go. They did have some amazing designer purses, including a $3400 jimmy chu purse that was huge and gorgeous for $1899.  

The designer section clothing was hung on nice wooden hangers with their logo (Nice touch). 

However....... The items I saw around the store, and my friend with me agreed, seemed like more than 40% really were more appropriate for a thrift store, and a lot of the items were really dirty (and still had high prices). You could see food stains on a dooney bag.. a coach wristlet, black, had white food smeared all over it... still highly priced for as dirty as it is. The thing is... even if it is a brand.. sometimes your store reputation is worth more than the 10 bucks you'll make by selling something dirty. Just my .02. 

I saw sensors put though jeans pockets, wallets (in the leather!) and other questionable placements. When I asked about it.. the sales person just said, well maybe there is someone new who does not put it in the right place. That damages items people are buying, and they may not realize the big holes placed by those sensors. 

I loved there ""on the web"" tags. I've never seen that before, but they are really pretty and catch your eye if you want to take a closer look. 

I prefer consignment stores to identify the sizes on the hanger by color coding or some such to make it easier to find my sizes. I get bored really fast trying to find my size..  As a consumer, I would have spent more time looking had I been able to really scan the racks easier for size.

The shoes are nicely organized.... and clearly labeled. They were not over crowded so it was easy to see the shoes. 

There are some positives.. I purchased a le sportsac tiny bag for 9.99, it was new so i do feel it was a good deal.  but really be careful what you buy.. The prices for the purses seemed high for used resale and their obvious usage stains.",2011-12-06

Two burgers, an order of fries, a Manhattan ($10), a beer = $55 with tip. Nice little spot, but hard to justify the cost.

The burgers were decent but not rave-worthy, the glass seemed underfilled with the Manhattan - though what was there was tasty.

The coffee is good (I hear from my wife) and the cinnamon roll is a real treat.  Not the best cinnamon roll ever in a million years but a good 8.5/10.

6340,730,4470,"Good barbecue, but not great. I ordered the BBQ Sampler and shared with my wife.  With an extra side and a delicious chocolate chip cookie for dessert, it was plenty of food.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food wasn't as high as I was expecting based off of all the Yelp reviews. All of the meats were very tender... The brisket and pulled pork especially.  But they were devoid of significant taste and had to be drowned in BBQ sauce in order to taste anything.  Thankfully the sauce was excellent and readily available.  Of all the meats I sampled, the winner here was the ribs.  Definitely not the meatiest, but extremely tender. I could pull the bones right out and devour.  Delicious!

Outside of the food, everything was excellent.  I arrived at peak time on a Saturday night, and the line moved quickly.  It snaked through the restaurant and out the door, around the corner, but it moved quickly.  We waited no longer than 30 - 40 minutes.  All of the servers were extremely nice and helpful.  There was plenty of seating available, especially outside.  It was a lovey place to enjoy a meal.

The Korean dishes are pretty authentic, and the home made kimchi is great! I recommend the bulgogi, bi bim bab, and spicy pork for meals. Lunch time is the best time to go, as their lunch specials are amazingly priced for the amount of food that you receive. 

The one complaint that I have is that they don't stock a few of my favorite kinds of sushi (although I know they aren't the most popular) mackerel, quail eggs, and surf clam won't be found on the menu.",2012-05-11

We started with the Freshie Rolls with warm Peanut Sauce and Lychee Martini. Nice, but not the best in town (Pure Sushi Bar has a to die for Lychee Lemon Drop).  

The entrees are huge and could easily be shared. We had the Kimow - hot and spicy clear noodles, chicken, broccoli, snow peas, sweet onion, Thai chili, garlic and sweet Thai Basil - Delicious!

The instructors are great!  They always take the time to say hello outside of class and they are very caring.  

The class ratio is fantastic - with a max of 3:1 in each beginner (Starfish) class.  

Currently the price is $72/month, which includes 1 class per week during the Spring and Summer and the ability to schedule unlimited classes per week from October-February.  The school also routinely sends emails for a free class when there is same day availability (usually with newer instructors).

The only reason I am leaving this at 4 stars is that my daughter has struggled with swim lessons in the indoor pool because some of the sky lights are not covered/filtered.  She is very sensitive to light and I am concerned she may not be able to progress with the way the skylights are currently.  Only time will tell!

The simple yet effective decor is vibrant without being tacky.  The service is very friendly and helpful.  They are always smiling and it actually seems sincere!
This is one of those places where you order your food from a cashier and they give you a number and you choose your seat from one of the 16 or so tables.  There is a nice little patio as well.  There are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order. 
1. Fill your cup with your beverege of choice (Soft drinks and Tea only- no alcohol, hence only 4 stars).  Do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-AND I DO!  And because I am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough, I grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the Hot Chili paste to bring to my table.  You can, of course, choose chopsticks or a fork.  I usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks.  I pretend I know exactly what I am doing.  But these never work as I cannot get enough food into my mouth quick enough so I end up with at least 1 fork.
I am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table.  I barely have time to do all of the above and get back to my table and they are bringing out a gorgeous plate of steaming Hot Korean with black bean sauce and tofu, or the yellow curry ""panang"" also with tofu.  You can aslo get chicken, beef or fish.  The meats are hand trimmed and do not have that grisle part that is such a turn off at other places.  The vegetable are as bright and fresh as the smiles on the employees' faces.

Elote, teeth sunk in, amazing alert***

Spit shrimp cocktail, oh yeah.....its on.

Tacos carne asada, so fresh, so good.  Great chips and salsa, the thick kind of chips, authentic type, like in Mexico.

Not at all. Had a supervisor overheard how he treated my friend he would have agreed.

We pull up in the car.  It looks fine from the outside so we send in one of the five of us in to scope it out (check the menu, see if there's seating etc). Normal behavior. 


So my friend K, approaches the guy at the door and asks ""what type of food is served here?"" expecting a simple response like  ""American"" or ""here let me grab you a menu.""

Ready for this...??

HUMAN FOOD?!?!?!

HUMAN FOOD!??!?!

K is just an average potential customer, asking a fair easy to answer question.

Okaaaaay. Being the sweetheart K is, she goes with it (it: him being a meeeeeanie) and asks if there is outdoor seating.

He sarcastically, mockingly and and outright D-bagly points out how there is a seat yourself sign right nearby. 

How was this guy ever hired?

Again a more appropriate responds (TOOL:) would have been ""yea, the patio seems like it has some space tonight, AND I'D BE HAPPY TO GO CHECK FOR YOU"" or ""at this fine establishment it's seat yourself but usually the outside turns over quickly.""

If you have low expectations you'll expect a bored teenager who hands you a price sheet and stares at you looking bored.

Walking into the Total Tan I had pretty good expectations based on the reviews and even those were blown away.  Dallas was the person who helped me (I think he's one of the owners?) and he was sooooo friendly and knowledgeable I spent more than I was originally planning but I feel good about it actually.

I had looked at the pricing online so I had an idea of what I wanted but he explained things about the beds that I never knew and that none of the other salons I'd been to had ever told me.  He was super personable too, even asking for my name just during his explanations of everything before I had committed to buying anything.  He made sure I knew every detail of the beds, the differences, gave recommendations and was never pushy with any of it.  During our conversation several people came in and he always asked my permission first to take care of them and I don't think he had to ask for their names once, a good sign that he pays attention and remembers his customers.

I could go on and on because I was so impressed with his service and also the location itself (super clean, trendy, nice extras in the rooms like baby wipes and extra towels) but I think you get the point by now.  Just check this place out, you'll be happy you did.",2012-10-05

1153,919,1022,"This is a cool place for low key hanging out, killing time, chatting and relaxing with friends.  It is NOT a good night spot and doesn't work as an event venue like they seem to be trying to make it.

I've attended 2 events there and its basically a disaster in trying to make your way through the 200-300 patrons they bring in.  You get funneled in past the food trailer into the bar area which is packed with people standing among several oversized tables.  Only if you've been there before can you figure out that you can walk towards the boxing ring past the crowd to get behind the stage and into the retail area.  Once there you have to get a spot among the wares to watch the back (or the side) of the show that is going to take place facing the bar.  Both times I stood the entire night with my drink next to a display of $50 t-shirts.  Very nerve wracking and annoying.

1.  The old timey way they make drinks is very cool and the drinks are delicious but I have waited now 35 and 45 minutes each on different nights to actually get a single mixed cocktail.  Its insane how slow it is.

2.  There are rules to what you can get at which station.  One spot is just wine.  Another spot is just mixed drinks.  Lemonade - oh thats a different place entirely.  

3.  They use the boxing ring as the ""stage"" for shows.  Very hard to view the show there because of the odd angle its at.  Both times I've had to stand in the retail area while the performers faced the seating/bar area (which only seats about 75 people).

To pay more than $10 to see a performance at this place is outrageous.  If the owners want to be an event venue they could do it simply by doing some rearranging and investing in some more seating.",2011-05-17
2926,957,2341,"Good, fresh chinese food, a little pricey.

There are two types of chinese food. Cheap, greasy, satisfying chinese food in a questionable joint. And upscale atmospheric chinese food that aspires to captivate the same audiences that enjoy places like P.F Chengs. This would be the latter: an awhatukee hole in the wall version of P.F chengs. Very clean restaurant, nice atmosphere, and good service. You can tell their motif is such that they cater to the tukee types with a little more coin in hand :/. This is the kind of place you'll find a lot of older families, or much older groups of friends dining together in. 

Both the orange chicken, and the almond chicken were good, and were made barring on the side of caution when it comes to grease. They were big portions (for $8), with big fresh peices of white meat, fresh vegetables, and no MSG. There is no chance of this meal offending a pickier type with grease, textures, or flavors (which makes it less interesting in my opinion).

Both dishes were good, but nothing amazing from the 2 dishes I tried. 

The green tea ice cream was good, but I've had better green tea ice cream :/ . their version was a little too heavy with cream, and could have used some fruit, or something creative to go with the ice cream.

I used to go to one in CO all the time and I really remembered loving it- when I found out one had opened by my work, it secured a regular spot on my lunch-break rotation until I realized maybe I shouldn't be eating sandwiches all week.

We tasted from every section of their menu, including raw (butterfish and albacore), cooked (gnocchi and risotto), and meat (short rib and pork belly). Pretty much everything was ""my favorite,"" and a couple of glasses of Barbara complemented the meal perfectly.

77,74,76,"Went back to AB a few weekends ago, again for brunch, with a large group.  I was surprised to see that, although they advertise themselves as being a brunch place on the weekends, they have pared their menu down to basically 4 items.  The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch, but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good (if not diverse) food.  I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  We'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didn't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  It's the best french toast I've ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.  And, the bloody Marys are in the excellent range, I'd say just below the phenomenal ones at Dick's/Rokerij.  The service was also friendly and quick.",2011-06-24

Interestingly enough, I think it's bigger if you order it for dinner than for breakfast, but for either it's plenty big!  Muy rico with salsa verde.  I'm embarrassed to say that I've only had a few of other things on the menu (quesadilla and other burritos), but they've all been delish!  For some reason, though, I just get my mouth set on chorizo burrito.  It's seductive.
The folks there are very nice and sincere, and they know English well enough, although I think some are working on it.  
Tip:  You can order ahead!  Especially helpful if you're going during the lunch rush, when it seems like every kid from Seton H.S. is there.  it's pretty nice to breeze in and pay and grab your stuff when there's a gaggle of folks still waiting for their order to be called.    
Tip 2:  If you don't order ahead, you can place your order there and then go across the courtyard to Starbucks to grab a coffee (that probably costs more than what you got at Los Fav's) while you wait for your food, if you're so inclined.

1422,1090,1228,"I stayed here last month. It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles,   and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. 

The room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.

FYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.

My main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.

I guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities. But, if I could find another hotel close by with a similar price, I wouldn't mind staying somewhere else.",2012-02-09

9007,3940,5923,"If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars.  But, I'm not  rating it based on the food.  It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but won't split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote ""family style"".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served ""family style"" someone else may get what you ordered and you won't have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was ""this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties"".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, I'm pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I don't normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.  The reservation was made for 25 people!  It would've taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.  Worst experience ever!",2012-04-01

HOWEVER, the time has come for me to drop a star. I am a regular fixture at LGO and lately have noticed that they seem to be running out of some of my favorite items on a regular basis. For example, the MJ Cookie...it is one of the few items that makes my mouth water at just the thought of it. It's like a brownie and cookie rolled into one. So heavenly. Unfortunately, LGO has been out of the MJ Cookie 4 out of my last 5 visits. And these visits are at all different times of the day/week. I know they get busy and I know a restaurant can run out, but it seems to happen so frequently and every time it's a big, BIG let down. And sadly, the cookie is not the only item that they run out of regularly. Lately, I've had a hard time finding the pre-made salads that I like too.

My other issue just occurred and I cannot seem to pull myself out of the depression that it has caused. They no longer serve the green chile mac and cheese! Seriously. When I stopped in recently for lunch, I was so disappointed that this has been removed from the menu that I thought about walking out. I know that seems like a silly reaction to macaroni and cheese, but their green chile mac and cheese was by far one of the best items I found on their menu. 

Their sandwiches are tasty, but almost impossible to hold together. Their pizzas have great fresh ingredients, but always seem to be lacking something. And now this...no more mac and cheese. And they're always out of MJ cookies! It is a sad sad day at LGO. =(",2012-06-25

Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with Sekong By Night.  It looks like a tiny little forgettable restaurant from outside on the street, but once you step inside. you can see the owner put some thought into the decor.  It really looks Asian.  It is as though the owner went on a shopping trip to Phnum Penh and came back with tons of artwork for the place.  

The Amok fish is really nice.  Reminded me of a cafe I had dinner at in Siem Reap some 9 years ago when I was seeing Angkor.  The fish was fresh.  My wife wanted to switch with me (she ordered the Katheaw Cha).  

The Katheaw Cha is also very good.  

I ordered a Coconut Juice as my drink expecting it to be canned.  It was fresh, and smelled fresh (a pleasant surprise!!!)

My wife ordered the Grass Jelly drink, and it was also good.  

I really wish that this place was in Mesa AZ, as I would go more often.  Maybe so, I will make the drive again to this place from Mesa as appropriate.  This place was a pleasant surprise and I wish the owner great success.  I want this restaurant to succeed.

I ordered a chicken shwarma sandwich and expected a hot middle eastern sandwich filled with flavorful chicken sauteed with onions and spices and accompanied with crisp fresh veggies.  What I got was FAR from what I expected.  The pita bread was your typical crappy faux Wendy's style doughy flat bread 'pita', not a regular pita pocket.  Inside was some flavorless, cold, unseasoned chicken (and when I say flavorless I mean indistinguisable from a mouthful of cardboard).  They didn't even bother to put basic salt and pepper on this sorry meat.  The remainder of the sandwich consisted of raw zuchinni (WTF?!), chopped tomatoes, 3 leaves of romaine lettuce, and some bits of red onion.  None of the veggies had been dressed or seasoned.  Oh, there was also some hummus/tahini 'sauce' mixed in there (presumably for flavor), but I have never tasted anything so flavorless.  I imagine that wall spackle has more flavor and pizazz than this 'sauce'.  Come on Paisley, does your cook even TASTE what comes out of the kitchen?  Add some flavor to your food.

I raced to the fresh fish and noticed that even packed in ice their little fish eyeballs where cloudy and sunken into the sockets. 
I looked at the frozen section and found some fish that had a sell by date of 02/2010. There was other fish that was packed by the store  with no packed on or sell by dates. There was canned and boxed food past their expiration date. 
I checked out this place on the Maricopa County health department and they had their fare share of customer complaint driven inspections.",2011-08-06

There sandwiches are made with all fresh ingredients and their bread is wonderful. Next door is a place called Lux Coffee House. Erick is a hoot. They are very good to their customers and I had the best Vanilla Latte every here. You can sit here with your Bianco sandwich and surf the net with your laptop.

I am only giving it one star because I can't give it 0. Simply put i was very sick after dining there recently. This was the only meal I did not share with my family and therefor the only culprit to my food borne illness. I have enjoyed this place in the past but recently the quality has gone downhill. Now they are closed on Sunday's.

I wish i had read recent reviews on here before i had gone. they have slipped VERY far since there Diners Drive-ins and Dives days.

6031,3077,2501,"Tanzy, Yelp, and Lindsey deserve the biggest standing O for this event.  

I honestly think I am still full from the generous food options that kept flowing.  I kept thinking we were done, but OH NO here comes another course.  I felt like I was at a chef tasting menu dinner.  

Right when we got there we had a glass of Champagne and were seated with a olive and meat plate followed by some bruschetta and local made cheese.  After the event officially started we were hit with amazing course after amazing course.  With never empty glasses of wine  

My Favs:

Sweet Corn Risotto

Scallops (cooked to perfection with a parsnip puree mmmmmmmm)

Alaskan King Salmon

Center Cut Filet Mignon

Brussel Sprouts yes Brussel Sprouts (Tempura battered with a sweet relish AMAZING)

4 hour braised beef short rib (Talk about melt in your mouth)  

Red Velvet Bread Pudding (I will go back just for this anytime I am near the Quarter)

I can't wait to go back to Tanzy for a full meal but I don't know how I will be able to top this evening of amazing food.  

I was very surprised to hear they have been open for 2 years as I was really blown away with their food and service.

5408,620,3931,"Tradition at it's most... er.... um.... traditional. Every time i eat here i feel like i have been transported to any number of old family owned steakhouses on the North Shore of Long Island, or Brooklyn. The plush red velvet, the dark wood and button tufted leather... The place just screams STUFFY BUSINESS LUNCH. My first experience here was with a bunch of lawyer friends who were dying for meatloaf or a steak with creamed spinach... 

The entrance is through the kitchen. That may seem a little odd, but I'd bet it sells dinners. Who can resist the wonderful aroma. By the time you reach your table, you crave rare beef, as red as the decor. 

It's the kind of place where you forgo the trendy drinks and have a Scotch with a splash,or a Rob Roy before dinner. The steaks are perfectly prepared, the garlic mashed potatoes are wonderful. I love the place. It isn't cheap, and admittedly, i have never paid for my own meal there. It has always been a treat from some friend who wears a suit to work, or some more traditional back easterner who wants to share their bit of meat and potato lovers heaven.",2009-04-13
6697,1720,273,"Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.

Good selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.

I think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  

Dim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.

If you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.",2008-01-24

On top of that, the price is very reasonable.  I got the mini (which is 4 ounces) and it rang up to $2.14.  When I compare it to Desert Swirl (your other choice of fro-yo on the Westside), this is extraordinarily more affordable.

The service was not overly friendly, but just fine.  The ice cream chick was happy to give us some samples.

6632,658,177,"I am not a big beer drinker, so I can't attest to the many different options they have in that area, but I can tell you about their martinis.

They have a huge menu of specialty martinis and other cocktails that are all pretty darn tasty if you ask me.  My friend really liked the chocolate something or other martini, I had a pear one that was delicious and another pal really enjoyed the pomegranate press.

The food is pretty good or I was buzzed.  Or both.  We had the cheese pizza and an onion ring tower (both half-off for happy hour).  Which, by the way, truly is a tower of onion rings.  And then the waitress brought out a free piece of cheesecake for my birthday.  It was a great time had by all. 

But the best thing about Yard House is the location.  It's right by Kona and Z Tejas and if you start right at 3pm, you can hit happy hour at each location and then take the free trolley to Giligin's. Yes, I did this on Friday and it was TONS of fun. Try it.",2007-03-05

The espresso was perfect and did not require any sweetener. I also got a blueberry muffin which wasn't very good, perhaps it was low fat or something but I am very picky about pastries anyway. 

My biggest problem with this place is the fact that they do not have a bathroom. Coffee makes me have to pee and when I discovered this and had to walk all the way to the baby gap because the place next door with a bathroom wasn't open yet requiring me to pack up my computer and leave my drink and food unattended, it was a bit undesirable. I know it's a mall type area but it still surprised me for a drink/food place. It does not set the tone for a place to spend a lot of time which may be their intention. Also, I love John Mayer but they played his same songs over and over again. Perhaps mixing it up or putting on a pandora station would be better? 

The staff was nice and they have free WiFi.

8139,3172,2798,"Three cheers to Yelp for helping me find where in the Valley to go for real beef jerky!  The fresh stuff which has more beef than chemicals.  (The convenience store packages just were not doing it for me!) After checking out the website, I emailed good friends in Las Vegas (who used to live in Minnesota), asking if they were familiar with Von Hanson's.  (They have 21 locations in Minnesota - and ONE in Chandler.)

My roommate and I went on July 2. They were running a special for NY strips - buy one, get one free - so that was added to the plan in addition to the jerky.SCORE!  We picked up a half pound each of the peppered jerky and the cajun spicy.  $18/lb.  The NY strips were (if memory serves...) $14.99/lb, and the steaks were averaging a little over 3/4 lb - so super yay for the BOGO sale - it brought the meat down to regular grocery prices. I have to say - the quality of the meat is amazing!  Just looking at the cuts in the display case, I can declare Von Hanson's makes AJ's look like Fry's!  These were GORGEOUS!  Quite possibly the prettiest steaks I've ever seen!I also grabbed a couple pigs ears for my dog, and the roommate picked up a package of her favorite kind of sausage (linguisa).

Admittedly, I am not a sausage expert.  Plus, I live very close to Schreiner's - so while I would have no problem buying sausage from Von Hanson's, I wouldn't make the hike to Chandler just for those.  The selection was quite impressive, though!

Overall - this place has everything for carnivorial happiness!  (Hey - if you understood the context, it's a word, right?)  Great selection of beef, chicken and pork products.  Tons of spices, sauces, rubs and marinades.  Nice selection of unique beer and wines.  Fridge and freezer cases with more meats, sides, and desserts! Yes, it's pricey - but the quality is certainly there to justify it.

Once home, we grilled up the steaks using our favorite rub.  OMG amazing meat!  Probably the best steak I've had in YEARS - and NY strip isn't even my cut of choice!

The peppered beef jerky is full of YUM - and this is so strange to write - but the Cajun is a bit spicy for my taste.  (And I adore spicy!)  It's amazingly good, and addictive - but almost requires a cold beer to go along with it to help cut the heat.

The Vegas via Minnesota friends emailed back Monday - they know Von Hanson's quite well - and are grateful there isn't one in Vegas - it would KILL the weekly grocery budget with how often they'd be in!  They love, love, LOVE the place - and I am now under strict orders to bring them care packages from here whenever I come up to visit!

Oh - and Layla (my pooch) was pretty stoked about the pig ears - so in addition to my five stars, please add two paws up!  (I didn't tell her they have a whole dog food and treat section - I am on a budget, after all!)",2011-07-07

So one time ended up getting 6 (maybe a few more but the beers were going down pretty easy that night) different items.  Each one well thought out and fun to eat.  Yes, I said fun. One was cooked by us on a hot rock, and the others made us investigate each tasty bite.

One night I saw the owner cleaning the place without gloves and she was nice enough to give us a to-go parcel without cleaning her hands (great example to the servers!). I had a peek inside the kitchen when the door was ajar, and it definitely looked dirty.

Your burgers with their fresh toppings are delicious... but sometimes I just need a little change of pace, maybe something with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and bacon... mmm... bacon.  Oh, sorry.  You want to know the name?  I don't see why that...  You insist?  Okay... it's Five Guys.

Oh!  You're upset!  YOU'RE upset!  Well let me tell you what - Five Guys' fries are delicious, whether they come in Cajun OR regular!  And I NEVER liked your fries, In 'n' Out!  I just pretended to like them, but they're skinny, kind of limp, never flavorful, and you don't get very many.  Five Guys cuts 'em thick, salts them up, and pours an extra scoop into the bag, how do you like that!  And they give you FREE peanuts to munch on while you wait.  You never give me anything!

What?  No... you're right, Five Guys is a more expensive taste.  That's true, it is over $10 for a burger, fries, and drink, as opposed to your $5.  And I do have to park in a garage that loosely resembles a labyrinth designed by Escher.  But if you eventually make it up to the restaurant, they VALIDATE.  You have NEVER validated me!  Oh, that's right, you have surface parking, but don't try to pretend that's a feature with the temperature hitting 100!  You're ridiculous.

What's that?  Does Five Guys have milkshakes?  Uh... hm.  Milkshakes.  I never thought about that.  They don't.  Would you mind if I got my burger and fries from there and then came to you for the shake?  No?  Fine.  You're so overprotective and hyper-traditional sometimes.  Live a little.

I am just as shocked as the next person that after many years in Seattle, I had never had Bubble Tea.  Gasp!  You can get it almost as readily as Starbucks.  I learned it's also called Boba and maybe one other name.  It's all the same to me.  Same-same.

I had my first boba initiation at the recent Office Hours with Gabi.  I was completely overwhelmed by the options presented to me: what type of chewies (for the record, that term just doesn't seem right), base drink, optional flavorings, etc.  It was a lot for this gal to handle.  Luckily, Alica B. was at my side leading me down the boba path.  

She helped me pick out a concoction of Thai iced tea and regular boba.  Gotta start with the original boba, right?  She ended up with a coffee drink with coffee jellies.  I feel like I'm now ""in the know"" because she asked for the coffee jellies and even though they weren't on the menu, they indeed had them.  That's a little insider's tip from me to you.  Wink wink.  She was so excited I thought she was going to consider this woman the Patron Saint of Boba and commence worship on the spot.

I was surprised to find how incredibly filling boba is.  I wasn't hungry for hours!  Overall, it was good.  I don't see myself craving boba, but if someone wants to go, then I'm in.

First of all, they have an extensive wine list, which includes a rare type of sparkling wine, called Brachetto. In this area, DUI's are more common than a cold, and it's a light and tasty wine, with a low alcohol content. So it's option is great for me. It also goes great with everything they serve, because of it's unique flavor profile.

Lizzie was our waitress, and offered options and suggestions, which actually saved us quite a bit of money on the whole. Not that, by any stretch of the imagination, is this a place to go when you are not intending a big splurge. This is a place to take it slow and spend slightly over a decent amount. 

The food, however, is absolutely worth it. We tried the Cheddar fondue, which could have used a bit more mustard powder and worstershire sauce, but on the whole was delicious. It was well prepped, and Lizzie explained what she was adding and why the whole time. The veggie selection is a bit mundane, and that's really my only complaint. We ate the ""big night out"" prix fix menu and chose the ""Fusion"" option which had lobster tail, shrimp, brats, ravioli, new york strip, sirloin steak, and a marinated chicken. We cooked it in the Boullion method which is just a flavored broth. Because it's not oil, you do need to add 30 sec to a min to the suggested cook times, but it was a lot lighter than using the oil and we didn't come home smelling like oil. The california salad was incredible. It had mixed greens, sliced roma tomatoes, chopped pecans, and blue cheese crumbles with a rasberry black walnut dressing. It's been a long time since I was able to truly enjoy a salad, and this was amazing. The chocolate we chose was the Smore. It was milk chocolate, marshmallow creme flambeed with grahm cracker bits added after the fire goes out. It's served with 2 types of coated marshmallows, pound cake, a slice of cheese cake, and a bowl of sliced strawberries and bananas. Just enough to fill us up, but we didn't overstuff ourselves. Our dinner was leisurely paced and took us about 2 to 2 1/2 hrs to get through. This is pretty normal for fondue. You do have the option of sitting at the bar and having just a cheese or chocolate, if you are on a time constraint though.

I read one review about some poor girl stepping onto a treadmill that was going full speed and falling off... who does that?? Did she not see the treadmill going FULL SPEED? Don't blame lack of common sense on the gym or its staff...

Another review complained that there are too many gay men hanging out in the locker room. REALLY? As a straight male, I can say that I've never felt uncomfortable, and have never been solicited for sex in the locker room. Get over yourself and your homophobia dude. Some yelpers truly disgust me....

Great location in a beautiful new area, convenient hours, tons of parking, a BEAUTIFUL state of the art facility.... what is there to complain about?? Show up, work out hard, and go home feeling better about yourself... that's what gyms are for!!",2012-08-07

8351,425,5580,"i enjoy Barcelona.

when i moved to Scottsdale, AZ, this was he first bar i went to.  It was right down the street from where I lived (which ended up being a great location).  

all of the greatest friends i made during my year there i met here and im still in touch with today,

i normally dont get into that whole ""club"" scene...but i always had a blast when i was there.  

i do have to say i would never go there looking for a Mr.  if i was single.  i don't care for Scottsdale men, they are WANNABE's, drive their BMW's yet live with like 6 other roommates just so they can AFFORD that BMW.  If there was a section on Yelp about Scottsdale men, i don't think there would be enough room for my negative opinion.  this place is full of them YES.  

But like i said, the service is great, i loved my bartender James.  and i always had a BLAST when i was there.

i miss you Barcelona. xoxo",2009-12-06
2958,1112,2366,"I consistently enjoy Chelsea's Kitchen, even in uncomfortable circumstances (long story). This last time was no exception.

We started with ""white"" sangria, which none of us had heard of before, despite prior visits. The ""white"" is a pinot grigio so it was an easy decision to order the pitcher. The sangria was delightful - we didn't quite finish the wine, but the pitcher-ful of fruit was polished off.

My swordfish tacos were delicious and filling. My friend's fried chicken (a special) was good but a bit dry. I suggested gelato after dinner; no one had room.

Service was a bit inattentive. The table seated after us received menus, waters and had their order taken before we had a server approach the table. After the first server, another seemed to take over and things got better.

The atmosphere at Chelsea's is good, as others have pointed out. It's a great place to hang out. The setting is beautiful. I will return.",2009-06-25

3027,1964,331,"How can I not show yelp love for the original fro yo shop that kept my addiction fulfilled in the early days of the fro yo phenomenon? Yes, that is what Golden Spoon is to me. 

When I first moved to Phoenix from college, I was coming from an area that was overloaded with frozen yogurt shops for the college girls who shared my love of the frozen treat. Unfortunately, Phoenix hadn't quite yet jumped on the bandwagon and so the only choice was Golden Spoon. To make matters worse, the only locations were north on Shea or South in Awatukee. So, since I was living in Old Town, the Shea location was typically my choice. 

I can say that I added several miles on my car very willingly to treat my taste buds to Golden Spoon. Yes, it was the closest shop to me but it's also creamy and completely delicious. The frozen yogurt is served by staff and comes in different sizes. You can choose from multiple toppings and it's just your ""old fashioned"" frozen yogurt shop. I'm using old fashioned very loosely in this sense, since frozen yogurt is anything but old fashioned, but with the self-serf trend, Golden Spoon is ""old fashioned"" compared to that. 

I don't visit Golden Spoon as often as I'd like anymore because it is still a bit of a drive, but anytime I'm in the area, I know just exactly where to stop for a sweet frozen treat!",2011-05-03
8787,1579,223,"A new player in the Downtown Phoenix food scene, Bliss is a creation by the folks behind the Fez, Switch, and Ticoz empire. They occupy a buliding once occupied by Fate and Nine|05, the former of which was one of my favorite restaurants.

Entering the restaurant, we were greeted with an odor of mildew and dirty water, which isn't exactly a pleasant way to arrive into an establishment. Being the only ones seated in the small space, we were able to really examine it, and I noticed one glaring difference between the way they have it set up and the way it was set up; it feels like a cafeteria. The installation of florescent lights, heat lamps, and massive amounts of stainless steel in the open kitchen make this place feel like a lunchroom at high school. Whatever, we can deal with it. An overview of the menu showed several options which seemed like drunk food... fried everything, cheese crisps, foot long hot dogs, slider burgers, tacos, grilled cheese, etc. Apparently ""comfort food"" means deap fried grease? NO THANKS. I ordered the Braised Beef Tacos, which had the consistency of paste, but were average in taste. 

My biggest gripe with this place is the microwave (not even a turbo chef) sitting front and center in the kitchen. Look, I understand that some restaurants use microwaves (usually not good ones) in their kitchen, especially if it's a cold kitchen (which this isn't) but having it in plain view and audible in the dining room is just atrocious. I truly hope someone from the restaurant reads this and hides the thing. It made me completely lose my appetite when I saw them heating my girlfriend's rice for her chicken skewers in the microwave. yuck. She did mention she was neutral about her food. We are people who go out at least once a day for a meal and try a new place every time, so we know food. 

Everyone we encountered was nice, and the service was very friendly. Everyone seemed interested in how well we enjoyed our meal, the space, and they seemed interested in welcoming us back. Unfortunately, the place looks kind of makeshift on the ReBar side, and like a cafeteria on the Bliss side. I'm not really sure why it looks makeshift, perhaps it is just because it looks like a temporary wall in the back of the room, or because it looks so bare, but it looks like they are in there just for the time being. 

I feel compelled to go here again but only for drinks out on the patio. The inside looks like Mexico, the food wasn't very good, and the cafeteria/microwave issues pretty much summed up this is not a place for a nice night out dining.

I also find it interesting how many reviews are by orange heads or people who were here for the ""vip opening."" c'mon, try the place before you write a public review of it, and by try I mean eat some food, and actually experience it.",2010-09-02

1803,1317,1527,"The only reason I'm not giving 5 is the misguided bus driver. After asking the driver if he dropped off at 'Pecos', not 1 but, 2 times, and he agreed both times, we wound up in Chanlder/Gilbert border NOT on Pecos. My mistake in thinking there was only 1 Pecos stop.  Newbie me had no idea. It was easier when our parents pinned our bus stop destination on our shirt when we were 6!

Stranded, about 8 miles away from my park n'ride, I was advised to call their help number. So, I called Customer Service who transfered me to Wanda, the dispatcher. I've never talked with someone so nice, helpful and compassionate - THIS is how customer service is supposed to be...HP, Dell, are you listening?! 

She not only tried to find me other buses to link and other routes to my stop, but in the end, tracked down a site supervisor Bob, down the road, luckily he was on a run, and took me to where I needed to go. He was so nice and understanding, I didn't feel like a total doornob. 

Tell you what, I can't think of anywhere else where their customer service was actually helpful, and hope these guys at least get a bonus, stipend or something.

The room mate and I made the drive down one afternoon for some lunch hoping that the experience would make the 30 minute drive worth it. I was kind of surprised when we pulled up. From the outside it wasn't quite what I was expecting. The place is located in a strip mall and nothing really makes it stand out from the road...but figured maybe all the awesome was on the inside. 

We get inside and there are quite a few people. There aren't too many tables and almost all of them were taken. I grabbed the only one available that someone had been recently sitting at and just cleared some of the mess left on the table away. I stepped up to the counter and placed my order for a chicken chimi. It ended up taking a bit longer than I would have expected, but when the food came out it was pretty good. Let me say this now, I'm comparing this place to the Filabertos and Rudolphos and etc. With that in mind, this place is great. The flavor of the chicken is unlike any you would find at those other locations I mentioned. If you compare it to that of items found at other diamonds in the rough, I think it falls short. It is for that reason I give this place 3 stars.

No rocking, no reclining (granted most theater seats don't move a lot, but these don't move at all).  Otherwise the seats were reasonably comfortable.  The screen is IMAX (i.e. huge), and the sound was reasonably good.  

They could have put a little more slope into the auditorium seating.  In other IMAX theaters I've been in it seemed the heads of people in front of you NEVER block any portion of the screen.

Maybe the lack of a lounging area or the weird particle board chic tables? Or the fact that every table was dirty except one by the blast furnace (front entrance).. maybe the grease dripping on the glass in front of the grill? No forks? I'm sorry if I sound like a banging on MB.. but these are things that can be improved on. 

The Mr and I shared a salad and a Cuban sandwich.. the control freak in me of course got off on the salad making.. this was probably the best salad Ive made to date.. you should be able to patent your creations! The Cuban sandwich was okay.. the ciabatta rolls are so thick and chewy that when you take a bite the toppings sort of fire out the back.. for a Cuban sandwich I think it had some sort of Asian spice, like cardemom?? Anyway, the Mr didn't like it at all. This being his first time he was confused as to why I went on and on until he took a bite of my patent pending salad, then it all made sense to him.

3561,2187,2761,"This place is absolute perfection.  From the setting to the service to the food, I loved every moment of it.  The only way I found out about this place was through Yelp.  You seriously are my trusty sidekick.  From the previous reviews I was a little worried that it might be packed, but then I remembered it was a Monday night so no worries.
Walking in the restaurant, it is quite small, but just absolutely adorable.  It really does feel like an upscale country home.  Wood lines the whole restaurant and they have mini chandeliers hanging over every table.  Even the touches of place setting are just perfect.
Our server was Gina and she was a complete sweetheart.  We started off with the Bohemian Sidecar and the Cucumber Vesper.  Both were absolutely delightful!  Then we moved on to appetizers, because while getting drunk is fun, I was really excited for the food.  We had the steak tartare and mussels in the saffron and white wine sauce.  I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top.  Put fried egg on top of anything and I'm sold.  Put fried egg on top of raw steak and I'm in love!  The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare, perfect timing!  The mussels were equally amazing if not more, and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread!  Well that, along with the bread and butter.  But that still wasn't enough for me!  I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness!
After Gina cleared that out of our way, she brought out the glass of Bordeaux and Rhone blend.  I hate when I don't have a drink in front of me, and she made sure that never happened.  Then the entrees came.  The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf, and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me.  Again, absolute perfection on both accounts!  I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy, with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese.  I'm getting hungry again just writing about it.  My bf loved his, but I still maintain that mine was better.  And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at $15 and $17.  Could life get any better?
Well apparently it could!  After we polished off our entrees, then came dessert and after dinner drinks!  We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise.  And the berries with the creme fraiche.  Heaven in my mouth!  We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini.

4743,2663,2837,"My husband and I were really, really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti.  We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34,000 miles (and out of warranty) to have the moon roof looked at.  The moon roof wouldn't open or close, but you could hear the motor working.

After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered, due to the fact that it's a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.  We were flat out denied.  Twice.  

We were dreading the big repair, and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big, fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.  Seriously?!?!  Just over $100 later we were on our way!

And before the Yelp paparazzi shows up to muckrack... no I didn't take Kristi to Cheuvront's. I know better than that - I only hang with Kristi at dive bars. 

So I did take my lovely date to Cheuvronts. The decor and ambiance - think wide open and urban and dark without being too dark. It really set a mood. We ordered a bottle of wine from a fantastic list, along with a cheese plate and a pate plate. We had them select the cheeses to pair with the wine we had chosen with a few instructions as to cheese preferences. They have a selection of pates as well, and we had them choose similarly.

The cheese plate contained three cheeses, all superb. It was served with (good!) bread, some nuts, and some dried cranberries. The two pate plate was similarly served with bread and dark, delicious mustard. The pates were fantastic - the cheese plate and pate plate seemed destined to be served together. 

The food and drink were great, the service a little spotty especially since there weren't that many people in there. I'm guessing the waitress just didn't want use to feel like she was bothering us. After taking our time to enjoy the wine, cheese, and pate, we were both feeling full with no room for even dessert. 

Overall, a great meal, my date thought it was one of the best places she had ever been to, and I'm clearly going to have to pay more attention to Kristi's reviews.",2009-02-26

Waterfront is a stretch, its a canal, a stinking fucking canal.. leave it to the Scottsdale developers and planners to put a Scottsdalian slant on the turd.. kudo's to them! However, with its chain stores and restaurants on one side and pretty lame so far on the other (Southbridge) this has become quite a giant and over priced turd.

2114,1487,1767,"I'm always searching for quality food at a fair price for lunch.  There are tons of sit down expensive lunch places and lots of fast food (junk food) places too.  When I read the reviews on Chestnut Lane I hustled right on over.  The concept is right on but the execution leaves a LOT to be desired.  

First challenge is getting a parking place and I was lucky.  The line to order didn't look too bad when I arrived so i was feeling lucky.  However, the line took forever to move forward causing the people waiting to shuffle back and forth in a very confined space as there was lots of foot traffic trying to enter and exit.  The woman at the register took each order, processed the payment, and then proceeded to prepare the drinks  and sides for each order.  The drinks are somewhat specialty items and are kind of labor intensive, especially considering that the order line is at a total standstill.  SLOW!  After way too long a wait, I finally was able to order...then the real wait began!  It was a good 25 minutes before my order came up and it was just a TURKEY SANDWICH!  I felt lucky, though, as the woman ahead of me in line was still waiting for her SANDWICH after I had finished mine and was driving away!

Sometimes a long wait is mitigated by the awesomeness of the food.  Well, at Chestnut Lane this is unfortunately not the case.  I mean it was a decent turkey sandwich, but when I saw the almost $16 charge for a TURKEY SANDWICH and ICED TEA I was expecting something fabulous.  It wasn't all that.  

If you decide to go to Chestnut Lane, maybe you could park in the spacious Jack-in-the Box lot just to the east.  And grab a Breakfast Jack to hold you over during your long wait!",2009-10-14
9696,4110,6262,"VERY FRIENDLY staff.  In fact, at times they seemed to be just a bit too friendly.  I get that they train their employee's to greet every guest, but everytime you see an employee, or make eye contact, they are either welcomeing you to the place, or asking how everything is going.  It was a bit of an overkill.  And the place is loud. Very Loud.  So loud it is hard to hear your table companions.  And every so often, the music would go up a little louder, and all the employees would stop making sure every single customer felt welcome and aprreciated all the time, and they all did a cute little line dance.Other than that, the place is great.  Nice atmosphere, great peanuts.

The food is reasonably priced and so very tasty.  I am sure they know this, because they are constantly asking how your meal is.  Well, not constantly, but pretty darn close.  I had the T-Bone smothered in Mushrooms, and it was cooked to perfection.  The rice side dish was a little sticky and over-cooked, but other than that, the food was an 9 out of ten.  

After we paid the bill and started to the door, again the service was overwhelming when no less than four seperate employess thanked us for coming and hoped we enjoyed our meal.  The place was packed, but still seemed a little over staffed.  I do like to feel welcome in a resturant, but not every time I turn around.

This bar/boxing ring/vintage store/food truck/soda fountain is super awesome! My cousin took me here a few years ago and since then it's been a place that I always show friends and family members when they want to go out downtown. The drink list is pretty extensive, with lots of organic cocktails served in cute mason jars. You definitely get a good sized drink! The beers are cheap, the food is so-so. I think it's a bit overpriced, so I'd recommend eating somewhere else beforehand. 

The boxing ring is random, but I've seen friends go up there and fight in a drunken stupor, and that is a sight I'll never regret seeing. Some nights they have karaoke, which I've chosen to partake in a few times. I've seen DJ's there on the weekends, and I really like how they switch up the music genre each time. Sometimes it's rap, others rockabilly and oldies. On Tuesday nights they do FREE swing dancing lessons and I've been really wanting to try that!

3946,314,3011,"I'm staying at a hotel in Tempe so I decided to let Yelp direct me to a sushi joint for dinner.  After reading several reviews, decided to try Sushi Eye since it was less than 5 miles from my hotel.

I orered the following:  Sashimi Plate (tuna, salmon, yellowtail), Hamachi Kama (grilled yellowtail collar), and Uni (sea urchin).

POSITIVES:
--  Price was very reasonable.  Total cost was $40 including tip.
--  The food was fresh and the portion sizes were great.  Even the Uni was extremely fresh and the amount was more than reasonable.
--  The Sashimi Plate came with soup and salad.  The dressing on the salad was excellent.

NEGATIVES:
--  The green tea was lukewarm and the waiter/waitress did not do a good job of ensuring my tea cup was always full.
--  It takes a very long time for the food to come out.  There were only 3 or 4 tables besides me so it wasn't a busy night.  
--  This is an odd one but I actually wished the Hamachi Kama didn't have so much meat on it.  Due to the large/thick amount of flesh, it didn't not have the crisp chargrilled taste to it.  Probably another reason why it took so long for it to be prepared.

Overall, I give it 4 stars.  I would definately go back and may tomrrow night.",2007-11-27

5805,3011,2175,"God Bless Lifetime Fitness.

First off, let me tell you how much I despise working out.  Like, at times I'd rather drink my own pee than even come within 50 feet of the stair stepper.  

However, LTF (have you noticed that I like to abbreviate?  Get used to it friends...)  makes my gym experience fairly painless.  Steve W, I salute you for aknowledging the value of such a fine work-out establishment, and I actually have many of the same opinions. But because I like to hear myself talk, I'll reiterate some of my favorite points.

First off, I'm absolutely not a fan of children.  Especially at a gym.  Lifetime has FREE childcare for kiddos 12 and under so us singles can flirt our way through our workout without your kids sniffling and screaming.  Kids can play and swim outside under parental supervision at the pool, complete with waterslides and some kid-specifc water fountain spray thing.  They love it.  And I do too.  WATERSLIDES?  I mean come on.  LoveitLoveit.

Lifetime's members span the board, which is nice because I like the fact that I'm not the most out of shape person there.  I also like that there is nice scenery to watch and inspire me to keep my feet on that god forsaken stair stepper.  You may even see a professional athelete or TV personality on occasion.  Who doesnt love that?

You never wait for a piece of equipement because there are tons of machines.  And they are not covered in meathead sweat, which is always nice.

My favorite part of LTF is the group classes.  Excellent teachers, classes every day of the week, and a good variety of options.  I'd like to see more coreographed classes like Hip-Hop, but whatever, Kickboxing Jam is pretty damn close.   

Locker rooms are always spotless, towel service is free, sauna and steam rooms arent full of weirdo naked people, and they have this device that dries your bathing suit in under a minute.  Ingenious!  

I've been a member of a ton of Scottsdale gyms but I drive the extra 20 minutes in rush hour to go to the Tempe LTF.  Doesnt road rage burn calories anyway??  Win-win situation.",2007-08-07
6992,846,3668,"My first and only experience there was excellent. The service was exemplary - the server knew the menu, was enthusiastic about it, and assisted us in choosing our items without being pushy. The food was exceptionally prepared and tasted excellent. The tzatziki was the best I've had. Nice and thick, with cucumber and spiced well with herbs and garlic. The spanikopita was also exceptionally with fresh clean tasting spinach and delicately textured phyllo dough. The pan fried calamari reminded me of Europe, fresh tasting, delicately fried in olive oil and not in the least bit chewy. The pita bread was warm and fresh and for dessert, the baklava had a complex flavor and tasted home made.

I couldn't help but bust out in laughter. Bartender laughed too, then poured more bourbon in my glass and winked.

I really liked this place aside from the geriatric nonsense. Great vibe & I loved the entrance, you walk right through the kitchen and can observe the chefs working their magic. The interior is dark and sexy, with some of the coolest wallpaper I've ever seen.

Due to its lack of windows and barebones facade, I concluded that this bar had the possibility of being the sort of place where, when I opened the door, I might bare witness to a mob boss or two trying to decide what they should do with the man they just shot...  but that wasn't the case.

What I discovered was a long corridor flanked by mirrored walls and strings of multicolored lights, as well as ample seating and classic video games to boot.  The games included PacMan and Golden Tee, accompanied by a dartboard and a pool table - enough to keep the gamer in any of us busy for at least a few hours of drink-sippin.

The drinks were cheap and strong, and the tunes were decent - however the digital jukebox put a frown on my face; I hoped for a Wurlitzer.  Our barkeep was friendly and efficient, and our drinks were strong and low-priced.  I think tap beer's only two bucks, and mixers aren't too much more.

1. Loved Chef Wade Moises when he was at SASSI in Scottsdale. I'm a fan for god's sake.

2. I'm a big pasta-crazed fool. Seriously love it.  

3. Love dwntwn Phx.

So what could go wrong? 

Service: 
No one to greet you properly at the door. The space is awkward enough as it is.  Staff was always inattentive and often seen hanging out at the bar. When asked why cocktails the ""signature cocktails"" took so long to prepare, the server responds clumsily ""Because I had to read and learn how to make them just now."" Yikes.

Back to the greeting... We waited about 2 minutes in the doorway listening to staff sitting at the bar chat about how they hoped they could close early that night. It was only 4:30 pm.

Vibe:
The space feels cold and almost clinical. With the lack of fabric in the space, it feels like I'm the ER of a hospital (minus the curtains that surround each patient bed.) The staff certainly doesn't add warmth. Also reminds me of a corporate staff break room. Art on the walls is just bizarre (read other's comments.)

The Cocktails:
They look good on paper. See my comment above about Service. That's all I can really say. 

The Food:
Each time, the Fritto Misto app ($9) was salty and sad to look at. Orecchiette with Sausage ($15) looks fantastic on paper, but never quite right. 

In fact, I've tried every pasta dish on the menu. I'm simply heartbroken. I crave handmade fresh pasta, but the pasta here just leaves me guessing... I'm I the odd ball out? Why do all these Yelpers love the pasta? It's wimpy and the proteins almost taste boiled (texture and flavor.) Approx quote from a guest, ""gummy handmade pasta that looks like bloated playdoh in water."" The sauces seem near amateur as if they were never tasted before serving. Usually on the salty side.

Forget about portions, price, space, ambiance, whatever. The important question... DOES IT TASTE GOOD? 

Sadly, no.

At each visit, I brought other notable chefs from the Valley. In one instance, the five of us ordered an entire dinner, ate a few bites of each dish, asked for the bill and decided to head next door to Sens for dinner (which is another review in the making.)

I'll wait till sometime in the fall season before heading back to Pasta Bar. Maybe it needs more time (although it's been open for a few months already.) 

As always, I'd encourage you to try it out and make your own decision. Wade is a talented chef who can do amazing things in the kitchen. I have faith in you my friend!

Side note... for those of you who fixate on butter and bread service at restaurants, do us all a favor and stick to your cheap filler salad bars. Bread and butter service is simply never worth commenting on as a crucial component of a meal unless it's stellar.  (BTW... I realize the irony of making commentary on the worthless comments)",2009-05-30

354,320,331,"Rita's Kitchen is a hidden gem located right smack in the center of the Camelback Inn. While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests, I think that locals might be missing out on its charm. 

I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night. 

Breakfast: 

Breakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mother's Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mother's Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain. 

Lunch:

Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind.

7091,1376,4906,"True fine dining has come to the Valley.

If you are looking to have a special dinner, this is the place.  And plan on spending 3 hours as it is a true culinary experience.

The tasting menu consists of options of 4, 5, or 6 courses, and they can be paired with wine, if you like.  This is the way to go and even for tasting portions, they are not micro-mini.

The choices for each course are extensive.  At least 6-10 each.  AND, the coolest part, is that you won't find any ingredient repeated twice.  NONE.  Yes you might find tomatoes in the same night, but they won't be the same type.  That's not easy to pull off, considering the variety of the menu.

But, while you are between courses, Chef Binkley will send out numerous amuse bouche - which, if you don't know, are tiny little one bit or one gulp appetizers like, mini sliders the size of a half dollar, or pancetta mousse in a shot glass.

We ate there for my ex-H's bday, and had 8 amuse bouche.  Also, if you let them know in advance you are there for a special occasion, you will get custom printed menus for everyone at the table mentioning the special event.

The ONLY drawback, is the atmosphere.  It definitely doesn't fit the quality and beauty of the food.  But, I still give it a 5, as the food is superb.

If you are a true foodie GO. I was excited the whole meal, as I couldn't wait to see what came out next!   If you are a meat and potatoes type with an uneducated palate, save your time and money, since you won't appreciate the menu at all.",2011-02-03

$7 for 5 large cuts of Hamachi sashimi. Add $2 for a bowl of sushi rice and you will be in sashimi heaven. The Ikura at this restaurant are the best I have ever tasted anywhere.

Beers for as afforadable as $3.25. Sodas with free refills for $1.95.

9235,1085,2490,"Hey, its difficult to find anything particularly wrong with this stadium, which is especially remarkable coming from an obstinate sports fan who intends to hate before he loves.  

Immediate impressions of the stadium are that it is very well-designed and constructed with fan comfort in mind.  Chase nails this aspect solidly.  The concourse are rife with eating and drinking options.  You literally cannot walk 10 steps without tasty, delicious stadium food beckoning your fat ass to indulge; polish dogs, ice cream, 24 oz. bottled beer; Peter fucking Piper Pizza (Mmmmmm!).  The concourse also opens up brilliantly into the field of play, and one can go take a break from the seats but still have the ability to watch the action on the field.  Very important feature, particularly with baseball where sitting down can become monotonous.  

The actual field of play is marvelously constructed, with modern and classic designs colliding.  The dirt path from the mound to the plate is a throwback to the 30s, while the pool in the outfield adds a very unique and ""Arizona"" touch.  Pretty damn cool.  The classic clockface in centerfield is beautiful, and the grade of the stands are perfect for the noise to reflect off the metal structure.  Now that its under new management, they are opening the roof much more, which is a HUGE plus.  Many fans have been complaining about the lack of open air since the stadium opened.

So two things that I don't like about the stadium, one ornamental, the other functional.  

First, the hokey, 90s-esque mosaic on the outfield slats.  Jesus.  How about an update?  Its just looks so fucking bad, its almost embarrassing, and has prevented the outside of this architectural masterpiece from aging with grace.  How about HUUUGE pictures of current players, or true windows to let the light in and perhaps a view of the distant skyline?  This would require, of course, for PHX to actually knock down the Garage Mahal and actually build an outfield skyline.

This leads me to problem #2, the aforementioned ""Garage Mahal"", the most deplorable, atrocious boner yet for our mentally-ill city planners and officials.  What a total fucking waste to build the most useless and overly enormous parking garage that ultimately discourages people from walking through downtown before and after the game, restricted the potential for bars and restaurants to be placed there instead (fuck, they didn't even give the option for ground level retail), and mostly sits at 1% capacity on non-baseball-days.  That would be 284 days of uselessness.  

Though this isn't the D-backs fault, it is a result of stadium proximity, so as a penalty, combined with those silly mosaics, it loses a star and red pigment.

Overall, however, Chase field is the tits and will eventually be a MLB classic.",2008-04-02
9797,2719,1360,"Having lived in Mesa and delivered sub sandwiches to some of the tweekiest of tweakers, I don't feel any shame in admitting that whole area now resides in a dead zone for me. When I get that itch to go out and tear up the town, waste away a lazy afternoon, or enjoy a nice dinner, I think of places north, south and west of Tempe. It's like my brain has one of those little electric dog collar things attached to it, and when I start to stray too far east, it gives me a subliminal zap so I erase Mesa from the map in my mind.

So naturally, Stray Cats is usually a place I visit when meeting up with others who have suggested it. 

Thing is, I always end up having a pretty good time when I go there. The drinks are priced reasonably and generally on the strong side, the bartenders are friendly and quick to serve. The music is pretty good, but I've never been here when a DJ's spinning. I used to like the fact that there was an air conditioned smoking room off to the side with plush couches and big televisions. The crowd is always diverse, friendly and easy to engage in slurred conversation.

It just doesn't have any special oomph for me. I'd much rather frequent Hollywood Alley a couple miles south, where there's pool and live music. Unfortunately it's also on the black list of Mesa, so maybe I should find a way to reverse that programming. It's not just tweakers and mormans, it's not just tweakers and mormons, it's not just tweakers and mormons....",2007-09-27

We have no reservations for Pizzeria Bianco, but a couple of friends just got in line and were waiting to get some wine.  Useless fact: they're 26th in line.  So in theory, at 5:00 we're in the first seating.  And so it happens, the publicly-underwritten public transit arrives (my one-way trip cost $1.25, my gf's unvalidated parking fee was $12) and two Hop Knots later, we're sitting down and waiting.  

Typical order, one of everything, two Biancoverdes.  At this point being almost review #200, the details are irrelevant.  The crust is great, the cheese is great, the Sonny Boy is uber-salty and delicious, fruity olive oil, holy shit these roasted peppers, etc.  Why is that person staring at me through the window?

Yes, scantily clad nurses will serve you your food, cheerfully chat you up, and be agreeable to a photo shoot at the end of your meal. You'll also appreciate the little things Heart Attack Grill does (i.e. conveniently placed mirrors at ass-level behind all the counters for any patron's ogling pleasure), and there's no shortage of little quirks that definitely give the place character (i.e. their refusal to serve any diet sodas).

The food kinda sucks, though. I'll admit I liked the huge and considerately chilled Coke bottle, but that's about it. The fries were quite...flaccid and stale, the burger didn't seem so fresh or special, and it was relatively pricey for the amount of sustenance you get. Even so, you don't need more than a single bypass burger, unless you're itching to be useless for the next few hours, or if you are a gorilla.

I passed it the first time cause my GPS said it was on my right but nooooo it was on the left.  We made a quick u-turn and there we were.  

It was clean and well lit and nicely laid out.  If I remember correctly there were either 10 or 12 different flavors.  I had Red Velvet and Banana.  YUM!  The Red Velvet was delish!  My daughter had RV and Cake Batter.  They had all the standard toppings and the topping area as well as the yougurt area was very clean.  The young people (oh god I sound old!) that were tending to the counter were pretty efficient and friendly.  There was pleanty of seating too.  Some nice larger, round tables and then what looked like a hallway had some smaller tables for two.  There were also tables outside.  It was a Saturday night and there seemed to be a steady stream of people coming in while we were there.  Some stayed, some got theirs to go.  They also had two flat screen tvs on the wall .  One was playing The Bee Movie and the other had Soccer.  Overall our experience here was a good one and we will be back.  I may even bump it up to 5 stars after I try more flavors.

My favorite time to come is very early in the morning to enjoy the sun coming up over Camelback Mountain while having some organic coffee and a blackberry bran muffin.

The breakfast at LGO has something for everybody, IMO. Try the Croque M'Dame if you want something really bold. 

The lunch and dinner options are great too. This is the only restaurant I have ever been that I could eat all three meals and feel like I was being served from a different kitchen each time.

The only draw back I can think of for LGO is the tendency for it to become very crowded. That's the best problem a restaurant can have, so they're probably not too worried about it. The parking situation can become an issue too, but for my time and money, it's worth it.

The burger was not much better than something you might get at Chilis, Red Robin Cheeburger, Cheeburger etc (my opinion). I think I actually would prefer a burger from these places over Delux.

Maybe my expectations for this place and burger were set too high and I was disappointed with the final product.

Pros:
The sweet potato fries and dipping sauce was very good. The service was excellent.

Cons:
Limited seating and basically rubbing shoulders with the person next to you because you are packed in so tight. T the lighting in the bathroom is very dark. I'm shocked techno wasn't being played when I walked in. I didn't like the trendy nightclub feel of this place.",2009-08-06

8620,1319,1677,"I'm torn with Cream. I've been to the usual clubs and lounges in Scottsdale enough to be sick of them, and Cream was something new. I like that Cream is emulating Vegas-style nightclubs, but it's obviously trying too hard.

The decor:

First of all, this place is PAINFULLY tiny. I've only been here once, and while it was half full, so it wasn't completely unbearable. But I can't imagine what it must be like when they have guest DJs and other performers in. A tiny place that's packed isn't popular. It's just... small.

The walls are covered in white (leather?), the tiles are white, everything is white - I get it, white like Cream? I appreciate the commitment to the color but the theme is waaay off. The hard surfaces make the place look cold and very hospital like - I would have liked to see more smooth lines and softness in the design, more flowy like cream.

The atmosphere:

The dig the loud music and the techno. I get so sick of hearing the same stupid songs on the radio. I love the change in scene. Phoenix/Scottsdale is so stale in terms of music. This is a nice change. But it's too loud when you can't even put an order in for your drink. I literally had to pull myself onto the bar (I'm tiny, 5'3"") so I could give my order directly into the bartender's ear.

They also had a really cool entertainment act - a girl hung from a hoop suspended from the ceiling wearing a white bikini. She was clearly talented in her hoop manipulating and was mesmerizing to watch, but like I said, this place is TINY, and there were several instances in which she was inches away from kicking people in the face. And THAT would have been worth the ridiculous cover I didn't pay (I try to find any way not to.)

The drinks: 

Overpriced and terrible. Maybe the bartender THOUGHT she heard me say I wanted a glass of vodka piss, because that's what it tasted like.

I doubt there will be any improvements made that will make me like Cream better, but here's hoping.",2010-05-14
9603,170,6225,"I was introduced to SanTan Brewery two years ago on a very cold, winter evening. My cousin knew I would instantly fall in love with this place, simply because I just love fine craft beer.

He was surely right because I visit SanTan three times a week because I simply cannot get enough of their beer selection. It's like an adventure every time I go. The staff is fantastic not because they're very nice and friendly, but they have the same passion and enthusiasm for fine craft as I do, so relating to them in that respect makes the experience fantastic.

I normally do not engage in writing reviews on websites like this, simply because I personally tell the management team my best regards but I will for this because people really do need to experience the joys this brewery has to offer.

I decided to go wired so after I did a lot of research on how to get a wire from my second floor to first floor for the entertainment center. I bought a lot of tools from Fry's electronics and then after I started actually looking at what I had to do, I realized it would not be something I can do myself.

I called good guys electric and they came over and ran a couple of wires using CAT6 instead of the CAT5 I would have used through the (nail-ridden) attic and through walls without any wires sticking out while they kept away from the electrical wires to prevent interference.

I returned the tools and wire I got from Fry's electronics and that made the install very affordable.

I'm very happy with the quality of my network speed now, being able to stream HD content from my server upstairs to the TV 200 feet away.

4830,294,2538,"This was really 3.5 stars and I'm rounding down to 3 for a few reasons...on which I will now elaborate.

District could be in any Sheraton, anywhere.  In fact, it is strikingly similar to Rum Fire, the trendy restaurant in the Sheraton Waikiki where I stayed for a few days this summer before my family arrived and we stayed moved to the family place.  The flooring, the red circular lounge area, the live music on Thursday nights...it was all the same.  Heck, even the menu was the same.  The difference was that in Waikiki there was a ""Hawaiian"" slant to everything and the live music was much, much better.  (And of course the beach front setting).  I get the impression that they are trying to market themselves as a ""downtown restaurant"" more than the ""place in the Sheraton""...but to be honest, it is your quintessential trendy hotel restaurant.

The bartenders were really friendly.  The wine list for a ""wine bar"" is incredibly lacking.  Nothing interesting, nothing fun.  The pricing is on par with what I would expect from a hotel.  The space is modern and trendy, something that there isn't that much of in downtown.  I love the charm of a historic home, but I also love sleek and modern lines.

We selected a few small plates, or appetizers, depending on which of their menus you are looking at.  The crab cakes were good, if nothing short of predictable, and the chips and dip were surprisingly unique.  A dill dip and a French onion dip provided a nice departure from the regular spinach artichoke.  I'm not sure this is a place that I would come to for dinner, and it is definitely not a place I would come to for brunch.  (The brunch menu is a typical hotel menu, with typical hotel pricing).  I think that for me District will just remain a place for drinks and small bites.  

I'm not going to lose my mind over this place.  It's not that great, I'd say it's fairly generic.  But the staff was friendly and it's within walking distance of my place.  I'm sure I will be back for drinks.",2008-10-30

In Arizona, there is almost nowhere decent to shop. 
unless of course you loooooove Juicy Couture, in the event of which, you should probably not even bother reading this review, because this kind of fashion forward clothing won't appeal to you. 

Acne Jeans? check.
Endovenera? check.
Ksubi? check. 
Nike? check. 

Covet starts off with an excellent men's shoe section, 
continues with an excellent men's clothing selection, 
and finishes off with excellent women's wear. 

It really is a shame if you haven't been to Covet yet. Do yourself a  serious favor and support a small business at the same time.",2008-07-09
4298,2485,1576,"My husband was born and raised as a British Expat in Hong Kong and loves the Chinese Cultural Center for its authenticity. There are some great, inexpensive and authentic restaurants there serving a wide variety of Chinese foods. There is a place called the Seafood Buffet on the west end of the plaza and the food there is fantastic and lunch during the week is around $7. Golden Buddha (next to the amazing wedding shop) has an inexpensive lunch menu and I've heard the Dim Sum is incredible. 

The grocery store in that plaza has tons of authentic Asian foods that you won't be able to find anywhere else. Just the smell of the different foods and spices takes me back to my last trip to Hong Kong and really adds to the experience. I don't know what half the stuff there is, but if you wander through the candy aisle you should pick up a few random pieces and just try something different. 

The Center has a festival around the Chinese New Year  where they have street vendors selling all kinds of goodies including a huge selection of decorative Koi fish and various cultural performances. It's really a unique place, especially here in Phoenix, and is worth an afternoon visit if you're looking for something different.",2008-12-15
7993,25,5397,"I've been in a handful of times, and last night was also no disappointment. After looking for a place to have a glass of wine late, I ended up here, as 3 or 4 other places in Old Town were either closed (Napoleon's and Tapas Papas Fritas both closed at 11 PM??? Well, Napoleon's closed forever, so I heard, but won't believe...) or dead. Citizen had a multi-course private affair they were finishing up. Kazimierz had some kind of themed jazz party going and was raucous and demanded a cover charge. But good ol' cosmopolitan-cool AZ88 was next on my list, where I had a fantastic Pinot Noir (and Tempranillo), cheese plate (their kitchen stays open till 12:30 every night), and warm and friendly convo with spot-on bartender Steen. Another bartender came in later and was relating his favorite summer drinks in a bon vivant fashion. They do have a killer Moscow Mule which is served in a copper tankard to keep it cool. 

I've been coming in here, on average maybe once or twice a year since around 2007, and let me say at AZ88 the good things don't change. They still have a tantalizing food menu (they are a full boar upscale restaurant), and a drink menu that, together, rival anything else, really, in Lower Scottsdale (and in much of the Valley). Not to mention the atmosphere that for me has the perfect combination of sophistication, decor, music (4 more stars for the DJ's mellow-ambient rhythms) service, and vibe that indulges all the senses wonderfully. I'm now making this place my default destination for treating myself or a date like VIPs, as they've shown what it takes to to be among the best at what they do.",2011-07-29
6853,1069,3456,"Whoa! This is the kind of laid back, homegrown, down right delicious place I expect to find in Seattle - not Phoenix! What an awesome surprise. Came here for brunch on Sunday and was so impressed that I can say I will make it a point to come back! All the breads and desserts are made in house and I was told everything is made with fresh local ingredients when possible.

The atmosphere is great. We sat outside and it was nice with prompt service, casual vibe that reminded me of Seattle or Portland, and the FOOD.... Wowie.

There were three of us... all three did omelette's of different kinds. I recommend the Local Breeze, sans prosciutto. So good! You can get potatoes or spicy cottage cheese as a side - I went with the cottage cheese and it was delish. The bread is also amazing. Nice thick slices for the toast. Best whole wheat bread I've ever had in Phoenix.

Speaking of the bread - they have a killer menu of different french toast options. If I had not been on carb restriction, I would have had one for sure. NEXT TIME. The PB&J and the Nutella sound especially good. Our friend got a half order and it looked terrific. 

I cannot stress how good everything was. But I can only give them 4 stars and not 5 because the coffee was really bad. A good brunch should have good coffee to go with. 

I will be back for brunch for sure and would also like to give them a try for dinner or lunch sometime.

I checked and at first thought it was a lemon seed but no, sure enough it was a cricket (in which i took a picture).  The way this restaurant handled an insect in my water was repulsive.

We had a table at 7, and even though we Happy Hour had passed, they still let us order off of the happy hour menu, so we had four courses for $30 a piece.  We started with Spinach Artichoke DIp, each had a salad (I had the Bacon/Bleu Cheese/Walnut - YUM), then I had the Balsamic Ribeye...  It was so delicious.  

One complaint, half of my steak was medium, a quarter was rare, and the other quarter was practically blue, but it still tasted great.  Oh - and the carrots were a little too sweet for me...  They tasted like sweet potatoes....

Anyway...  For dessert we had the bread pudding which was the best damned bread pudding I have ever had.  Add in the drinks (which were tasty) and our bill was still nothing too crazy.

Our server was just the right combination of hands off and hands on, and i dug her big time.  We ended up having a long leisurely meal, were there from 7-9, but it didn't feel like we were there a long time.  It was just a nice relaxing meal...

Loved it - best restaurant experience I've had since I moved here three years ago.  Can't wait to go back.",2010-12-15
6510,300,4573,"Hiking Camelback Mountain has to have been the most difficult 1 1/2 mile hike (Just up, 3 miles total) that I have ever been on. While it is not a very far distance the increase in elevation is over 1000 feet in that short mile and a half. 

The first thing that I recommend is either getting to Echo Park at bright and early (between 4:30-5:30 am) or, if you come later as I did just parking in the overflow parking. You can find a simple map to the overflow parking at: 

http://phoenix.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Camelback-Mountain-Trailhead-Overflow-Parking.png

The walk to the Echo Canyon trail head to the overflow parking is only about 20-25 minutes and it is almost guaranteed to be faster than driving around looking for a parking spot somewhere else. 

The trail itself takes about 20 minutes to actually get difficult but when it does decide to start getting hard it does not let up for a moment. There are chain link fences at a couple of places in the hike to stop people from accidentally tumbling over very steep ledges and even handrails at times for more support up the trickiest sections of the hike. 

The good and bad of this hike is how crowded it is. There will rarely be a moment where you wont see someone coming or going for more that 50 yards at a time. This means that while there is little to no quiet and privacy, that if something were to happen to you there would be plenty of witnesses.

The rest at the top is wonderful. The view is by far the best in the valley and something that I recommend to everyone. Take 20 minutes or so to eat a snack, drink some water, take a breather and take some breathtaking pictures from the summit. The summit is usually pretty crowded so you won't want to stay too long. 

Be careful on the way back. It can be very tricky navigating some of the areas and twisted ankles and even broken legs are not terribly uncommon. Again, take you time and take plenty of breaks when you need them and you should be OK.

Don't forget to take plenty of water, I recommend at least a liter per person if you go in the morning and more that that if you do in when it is warmer outside.",2010-04-17
6255,47,1488,"very nice setting, right next door to Joe's Farm Grill (previously reviewed and raved about). Friendly, cozy and crowded. Great, huge sandwiches and good coffee. I am picky about coffee though. A lot of places have coffee that tastes good but for some reason makes me very thirsty. Such was the case here, but it was ok. The absolute standout for me was the peanut butter scone. Never had one, or even heard of one before. It lived up to my hopes and I enjoyed every moment I spent eating it. 

Added bonus, the fresh dates were out at the farm stand. However, the plastic thing on the wall that was supposed to hold the cash for the honor system was empty of envelopes. I asked at the coffee shop but they didn't know. Said it was a different place. Well, ok, I went back. Stuck my money in the plastic thing. Figured even if someone else took it at least I did my part. It wouldn't be on my conscience. Had to have those dates.

I am very glad I listened to her. We sat at the bar and placed our order for edamame and bombers... And I might as well throw in some yellowtail because it was good last time.  After the gentleman takes my order another man walks up and introduces himself to me.

6857,3049,4768,"Very disappointed!!

I picked this place because of the reviews that I've read here.  I feel compelled to give my 2 cents worth.

We started out with jalapeno hushpuppies along with their remoulade.  The pups were very tasty (good start).

For our main course, we ordered the fried green tomato salad to share, my wife ordered the gumbo with a side of fried okra, and I ordered the fried catfish with double okra on the side.

The lag time between our pups and meal was LONG......outrageously long.  When they finally brought our meal, my wife didn't get her okra.  They explained that it would take a few more minutes.  Keep in mind, my plate had okra so I guess they must have forgot about hers.  It was no less than 10 minutes before they brought hers out.  

When we finally received our meal the bartender apologized for the wait and explained that everything they have is fresh breaded and not frozen which is why it takes longer.  I can understand how fresh breaded takes longer but you should find a way to do it faster or take it off the menu if it's going to logjam your kitchen.

All this being said, even after the wait, if the food was good I would be writing a positive review right now.  The problem is, the food was just so so.  The okra had NO flavor and was not fully cooked to a nice crisp crust.  My catfish flavor was ok but the breading was pretty thick.  My wife's gumbo was a little bland....almost like the roux was a little weak.

6123,1211,4338,"This dairy sells fresh milk, straight from the cow.  That's what they're licensed to sell.  They use organic feed (dried grasses), hydrogen peroxide for cleaning certain things, and iodine to clean the cows' teats (just like many dairies used to).  They want the cows to be out on pasture, but they need a bigger piece of land to do so.  If you know of a piece of land in the area, please suggest it to Jackie Calamos.  I love their milk.  As of this date, milk is $10/gallon, the true cost of the milk (or maybe even a little low).  Most of the milk you buy in the store isn't worth the price.  Forcing more production out of cows with hormones comes at the cost of quality (and your health).  SYD's has all the good stuff (the proof is in the taste).

1054,476,936,"I was looking into gyms around the area. Upon entering I was greeted by the front desk guy. I asked about memberships and then he said, ""Sorry we are sold out"". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered, ""Just kidding"". Trying to be a good sport I went with it. 

Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying, ""Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,"". In other words, no straight answers. 

We sat at the sales guy's desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. ""If you choose option A, you then can go to all the gyms."" ""If you choose option B, then only here"" . The whole time I could see the children's area and the kids were being completely ignored (and we are talking very little children). When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde routine. ""Well you only have today to make a decision, after that no price guarantee!!!""   From there he was down right rude.

I walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened. Like Sarah G, I felt horrible when I left this gym.  It was an awful experience. Ended up getting a membership at Tangible Fitness on 7th Street. They don't have the same amenities however it is locally owned, and the people are very nice there.",2010-08-23
5631,1241,4055,"This is an excellent place to watch a game. If I had only been there to watch a game I might give this place about 4 stars, but I'd had a long day, wanted to watch a game and unwind with a couple glasses of wine and some dinner.

I stopped in recently with a friend when  in the area and Roka seemed less than lively. Our guess that this place might be more lively was perhaps correct, in that it had 6 people at the bar rather than 4 and had about 30 flat screen TV's running baseball games and various other sporting events. We chose to sit at the bar, because I always think you get better service there and the restaurant itself was pretty slow at 730 on a weeknight. That thing about better service didn't really hold up here as it seemed out bartender was also handling issues around the restaurant and after I finished my first glass of wine the glass sat empty for quite some time before someone came by to see about a refill. I will tolerate just about anything as long as I have a cocktail in front of me, and as pouring drinks is the primary function of a bartender this was more than slightly annoying. 

We ordered the ahi appetizer for a starter (I know I should probably be slapped for even ordering something like this in a sports bar). I had a couple bites and they were okay, but parts of the fish were actually starting to grey, which can't be a good sign. For dinner we had the salmon and a flatbread. 

Both the bartenders on duty raved about the flatbreads. I believe they have never eaten a flatbread anywhere else or they probably would stop raving about these. It was a relatively flavorless bread, which was not at all crisp on the bottom or the edges, lightly topped with cheese, sauce and some bits of chicken. It was edible as a food dish, but the part I found off putting was that the bread seemed to be taking on the flavor of the wooden paddle it was served upon. Yes, I know you can cook bread over wood and it will take on the wood flavor, but I am 99% sure this was coming off the wooden serving board. I actually took most of it home and the taste went away by the next day and the whole thing was well served by about 5 minutes in the toaster oven.  

The salmon was also very very okay. The best thing I  think we ate was the broccoli side that came out with the fish. They were sharp green, flavorful and cooked perfectly. The fish was kind of overdone and uninteresting. I feel like maybe this place should go to a smaller menu to be able to have more consistency with preparation.",2011-11-03

If not for that, this review would be a 3 or 3.5 stars, but seriously, eggs don't like microwavization. Just ruined the whole panini egg sandwich for me.

The coffee was pretty good. They had a selection of 4 going from light to dark which is nice. Lots of places have you choosing between a full city and a french which is frustrating.

Service was very friendly, but a tad slow for the number of people that were working there. I think they were focused on a lot of large pickup orders, but when you sell bagels by the barrel, you should expect that.

Saw some people picking up said bagel barrels, they mentioned how their office would cheer upon their arrival and heap laurels and praise on their shoulders. They boasted that their upcoming performance review was assuredly positive with such accolades. I smiled at them and wished them the best in their fantasy worlds.

She was so nice and our friend can be a little overwhelming and has a strange sense of humor. She made sure everything we wanted we got. Even modified the desert special so we could have a hybrid of the white chocolate chip ice cream and a brownie dessert. My filet was wonderful and at a great price of 24 bucks... Me living in san francisco where filet's cost 40 bucks a piece this was up to par. The corn salad is also worth mentioning, wonderful flavors.

I most enjoy going around six, the sun is setting and the buzz of traffic makes Phoenix seem more alive. This is my own preference and I know many people who hate going at this time because of the loud traffic. The bacon wrapped dogs are made to perfection with your choice of mayo, beans, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, cheese, mushrooms, and lettuce. And to top it all off you can wash it down with a Mexican Coca Cola, mmm so sugar filled. Don't forget to bring cash and your appetite.",2009-05-27

Dateline 7 May 2009
Scottsdale, Arizona

    Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, ""That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff.""

    Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, ""I really like the onion naan.""  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.

    The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was ""...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger.""  This has not substantiated, however.

    Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was ""Yummy.""

    Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.

    An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.

    Jim W's blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; ""...ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldn't go back on a night when they have dancing again.""",2009-05-09

The 1$ carne asada tacos are straightforward; meat, cilantro, onion, grilled jalepeño - delicious! Saw some lucious burgers being served. Will have to try one next time.  Will definitely be back!

As with any outside venue, as a non-smoking asthmatic I appreciate adherence to the 50ft from door rule. I'm sure other non-poluters would appreciate as well. As seems to be the norm, smokers only care about smoking. I can appreciate that its an addiction, but think of others occasionally please.",2011-03-15

8862,593,5842,"I'ld give 6 stars if possible for each and every appetizer we have had. The tomato soup, caesar salad, beignets, and crab dip are all way more delicious than they have any right to be. However, the stand out is clearly the shrimp canapé - one of the best  appetizers I've ever had. Period. 

The other side of the coin is the at-best mediocre entrees. The first night we had a gift certificate and ordered an absurd amount of food and ended up leaving both the burger and meatloaf largely untouched. On subsequent visits the appetizers were consistently amazing and the variety of entrees just didn't live up to the apps. The blackened tacos were bland and tasteless. The meatloaf was swimming in liquid. The burger bun was overly toothsome and the burger bland. 

Long story short - order appetizers (which there are more than enough of) and you will be happy. Also happy hour is great but the wine is overpriced otherwise. 

Take away = worth it for shrimp canapé if nothing else!",2012-04-07
2984,1424,2384,"We went there yesterday a I enjoyed it. The atmosphere was fantastic, because they had a tv, plus they have a lot of pictures of Man V. Food, when Adam Richman came here. The service is good, because they waited for us to order, and were very patient.   I ordered the Jewish Slider like Adam did, but I didn't take the challenge. 1 order of Jewish SIiders are 3 sliders. The sliders were awesome. The meat was tender and really juicy. The cheese didn't really make a difference, it just added a little flavor, but the bun soft and chewy, and buttery which tasted like pancakes without syrup, and it was fresh. The potato pancakes put the lid on the jar. The potato pancakes aren't just a creative idea, it was very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are 3 reasons why this isn't a normal slider. Reason number one is the Potato Pancakes, reason number two is the meat isn't a patty, and grinded beef that made that slider interesting. Reason number three is that the cheese is melted. REALLY melted. I will go again, because the sliders are amazing.",2012-10-04

However I might not return there for Dinner or Take-out.

Dinner Entries are priced well above $10,  and generally use frozen vegetables (Crinkle cut carrots anyone, god I hate those) 

The last time I ordered take out, the quantity of my dishes was about half of what I got the previous time. (Fine, Can I pay you a little less than the bill?) and the food tasted sub-par and my naan was burnt. For this they get only 1 star.

The food, however, is very authentic, though they don't always have the exact ingredients that you would find in Hong Kong.  The dry flat rice noodles (ho fun) is among my all-time favorite Hong Kong dishes, and this place does it right. The clay pot dishes are also worth a try - really good.

My favorite thing about this store is that the staff tries so hard to treat you like a valuable customer.  They remember your name, ask after your kids and honestly act like they like you.

The burgers are OK, not bad, but not as big or as fantastic as I'd hoped. The fries were really good though...extra crispy. The atmosphere is really relaxed and friendly. We had our 9 month old and there weren't any high chairs that we could see, so it made it hard for us to eat (one had to hold her the whole time). Overall it was a nice place but not as great as I'd expected. We will try it for breakfast though sometime because the ratings on that seem to be pretty good.",2011-07-08
1971,407,1493,"So you already know it's a 50's diner with outdoor seating, and we're in the time of year now where sitting outside late night is nice especially after the club. I've come here a lot with friends late night, and the food was always scrumptious and service excellent, but after last night I MUST PROTEST.

I ordered the Bourbon BBQ Wings, a promising title appealing to my tastes exactly. They arrive with a generous bowl of ranch and a few stalks of celery. I know most people don't eat the celery, maybe that's why, so I guess carrots were out of the question.

THE WINGS WERE FROM BABY CHICKENS!!!
I was shocked. some of them (both sections) were not 1.5 inches long, I swear. The sauce was yummy BUT I'M ANGRY ABOUT THE WING SIZE!!!! 

Come on 5& Diner, you're better than Long Wong's, ACT LIKE IT and serve up goodness on all fronts!
(See my scathing review on them as well.) I want so much to write a glowing review here but NO.

So my friend got the Southwestern eggrolls. They were sliced open diagonally and nicely presented on the plate. I tried one, and eventually my friend let me have the last 2. They were hard and irritating to eat, and tasted fine for tourists as it reminded me of Rubio's or Arriba's standard. I think Jack In The Box could've put out a better product overall.

Another friend got the chicken quesedilla.
Although I didn't taste it, presentation looked nice with the pico and guac on the side. The quesedillas were a good size and thickness. My friend took half of it home.

I can recommend the burgers, onion rings, and breakfasts.

Prices went up a couple of years ago to an average $9.49 for a burger plate, and slightly less for appetizers and other things. Service is always good, but don't go if you're in a hurry and the place is packed.

BOTTOM LINE.... choose wisely. Last night I chose.... POORLY.",2011-10-02

Thought I was off to a good start getting new glasses.  I picked out my frames while I waited to be taken care of.  

Oh...wait...the eye glass gods had something else in store for me.  

The person helping me couldn't get an authorization code from my insurance company because it was afterhours.  He actually told me I had to pay full price or come back tomorrow.  Now keep in mind that I have had this insurance forever, never had any problems before; after hours, weekends, etc.  So I used my cell and called the insurance company.  I get someone on the phone who is trying to help us.  I put eyemaster guy on the phone and he actually got into a fight with the woman on the phone, handed it back to me and said here you talk to her, I'm done.  

So the lady got me the authorization code and a explaination that this doesn't happen because most eye glass providers can take care of everything in spite of the insurance company being closed and she also asked me if I was sure I shouldn't switch eyemaster locations due to this guys behavior.  

But I thought I was done.  I have my glasses picked out and I needed them to drive.  So while she was talking to me the guy at eyemasters was throwing out insults loud enough that the lady could hear.  

So I lost 1/2 hour of my time and think the worst is over

Well...those darn eye glass gods...I can't get them in an hour because it was too late in the day the guy tells me.  He has the right lens and it was only 6:00 pm,  come back tomorrow.  

So I called today and was told 1/2 hour and they will be ready.  I drive over there on my lunch hour and guess what.  They aren't even close to being ready.  So I walk around the mall, come back and guess what, only 1 pair is ready.  That would normally be ok but the attitude of the two guys working is arrogant and not very customer friendly.

I asked general questions about not discounted pricing, nine dollars for a Manhattan made with Jack Daniels and beers ranging from five to seven dollars... if I'm paying seven bucks for a pint at a sports bar in Tempe it had better be something from Russian River or a Stone anniversary brew... and a nine dollar Manhattan seems out of place... this isn't Scottsdale or a hotel bar.

8412,218,1360,"I think I'm in love. If I only lived closer to Downtown Phoenix, I'd leave my mark on the Lost Leaf in the form of a permanent intaglio of my ass cheeks on a bar stool. 

It's tucked away on a side street in a humble looking home cum art gallery cum bar. It can be a little tricky to find since no sign exists, so keep an eye out for the neon lit open sign. You definitely don't want to miss out on this place by becoming frustrated after fruitlessly ducking down side streets, saying fuck it and going to The Roosevelt. While it wouldn't be a total bust, you'd be missing out on the warm and inviting ambiance of the Lost Leaf.

That's really what won me over about this bar. It made me feel downright cozy, with exposed brick and wood, local artist's artwork decorating the walls, and the actual kitchen serving as the bar. The main room is large enough to host a large group, but small enough to be homey. The acoustics are very good (soft talkers rejoice!) and the music playing was loud enough to add to the mood, but nowhere near the point of drowning out conversation. There are a couple rooms in addition to the main bar area that you can duck off into for more intimate conversation, as well as an outdoor patio that's a little on the small side but, super score--there's ceiling fans!

I found the prices to be very reasonable and the service to be unpretentious and helpful. There are no beers on tap here, but the selection of bottles is mind bogglingly extensive. I had to ask the bartender to get me his favorite pale beer and I ended up finding out that I am also in love with a brew called 1664. Looks like a wine cooler, but manages to be respectable instead of laughable.

The sauces are light and fresh tasting.  Plus, I'm lucky enough to be in their delivery zone.  When I get delivery, the food is still hot and tastes like it was made just a few minutes earlier.

First and foremost, talk about a professional, classy organization.

3338,2101,840,"I agree with the other reviewers.. Ink bomb is definitely a shop that has a family vibe. All the tattooers are down to earth and have you, their customer in mind. There are usually 3 or 4 tattooers there, giving you a wide variety on technique, style, and experience.. all of which are important when picking your tattooer. I suggest always going in and having a consultation and looking at each persons portfolio to choose someone who fits your style whether it be ""New school"" or ""Traditional""   This shop has on open layout and a friendly vibe which allows your to let your guard down a bit.. because we all know tattoo shops can be intimidating....

Yeah it is kind of cool that they are dressed as nurses and you get a little hospital bracelet with their name and such. However, putting on mandatory hospital gown is odd and kind of off putting (To me anyhow). They also do have a bar and sell unfiltered stogies of some kind. 

They also do not take CC!!! WTF I say! Is is a bit too much ""Old times charm"" for my taste. There is an ATM right in there so there is no real need to bring cash with you.

8299,3758,5550,"I absolutely LOVE Club SAR! I joined back in 2010 (I think...). At first, I just went there with my ex (who lived in So Cal and had been boxing) because I have always loved the sport of boxing and wanted to get into it myself (maybe even join the boxing team).  Sadly, I exceeded the age limit to join the boxing team, by a few years...  :-(
But, at least I could still learn and get fit.  :-)
We just walked up to the entrance and just took one quick look around and it seemed crowded and small so we were not impressed. So, we left.
I found out this used to be just a boxing gym before but eventually they added other classes and equipment for others to enjoy. 

Glad I went back later on my own and found out how affordable it was!
I checked and tried a few other Fitness centers and gyms nearby but, when I decided to actually try one of Club SAR's boxing classes, I was hooked! For a mere $3  (a day) drop-by fee, I was able to get one of the best workouts I ever had. I joined after I found out it only cost $75 for the whole YEAR which includes ALL the classes I can take (Boxing, boxing conditioning, Yoga, spin class, kickboxing, weight training, MMA... Yes! MMA too, which I personally love.  :-) ). Jonathan & Carlos are great and so is Tom. They're funny, friendly, and they actually remember you after only a few classes. 
The pricing has gone up this year but it is still by far, the BEST possible deal you can find anywhere in the Valley. 

Fees 
 
YEARLY Membership  Resident    Non-Resident 
Adult (18+ years)       $99                  $150 
Child (14-17 years)    $50                  $75 
Daily Drop-In Fee $3 Residents; $5 Non-Residents
 
If you are serious about getting fit, staying in shape and getting a good old-fashioned workout without all the ""posing"" and pretentiousness of other gyms which are more like ""meeting places"" and ""meat markets"" for the young Scottsdale wannabes, this gym is definitely for you!

Personally, I recommend the boxing classes because they will kick your butt, they are fun, get you fit and, in shape. :-)
They just got new heavy bags so there are 2 heavy bags, 1 hooks bag, several ""Bob bags"", 2- double-ended bags and 3 speed bags in the main workout areas. Plus, a bunch more standing weighted-base heavy bags in the other ""kickboxing/Yoga room. And, in case you didn't notice from the picture, a full-size boxing ring. 
Yes. I am totally endorsing this gym! 

P.S. This is a ""no frills"", serious gym. 
So, no whinnying and crying. Suck it up and do some push-ups!  ;-)

2420,114,526,"Since The Mission is getting ready to celebrate their one year anniversary, I figure it's time for an update.  I went in for my first visit last November, shortly after they opened, and I've been in countless times since.  The atmosphere is amazing, the staff welcoming, the food unique and tasty... oh, and the drinks go down easy too!

The Mission has become Jared's second home - he's there much more than I am!  I go for an occasional drink or dinner.  My favorite menu item is the tableside prepared guacamole.  It's fantastic!  I am also a huge fan of the white bean puree, the street corn, and the salmon.  I wish they had some lighter options on the menu though - just a suggestion on behalf of those of us that are health-conscious!

If you enjoy Latin-inspired fare, for sure go check out The Mission... Or at the very least, go in for a drink and some guacamole.  Look for Jared at the bar when you're there!

I""ll for sure be excited to celebrate The Mission's one year anniversary in late October.  I'm sure it will be one helluva party!  It always is at The Mission!",2009-09-11

The restaurant next door, Bobby Q, has rave reviews, so it seems like a convenient place to eat, but that seems to be the only dinner place around. Good thing it's the Residence Inn, with a small kitchenette.

This is probably the cleanest hotel I've stayed in all year. The dishes and silver wear are very clean and housekeeping keeps it that way daily. I've stayed at places twice the amount of this Residence Inn in Scottsdale and dishes in the kitchenette were filthy. 

Small workout room but you can go to the LA Fitness down the street for free.  Oh, they don't skimp on breakfast-waffles, eggs, sausage, yogurt, fresh fruit and hot and cold cereal.

Looking for good Chinese so yelped the area and Dragon Palace popped up with good reviews.  Comments about the outside are right - little corner spot in dated strip mall but who cares if the food is good....and it was!  We ordered three lunches to try out different dishes.  Both of us loved the egg rolls along with the sweet n sour chicken and the house chicken.  Not as thrilled with the beef and brocolli - nothing special on that dish so will stick with the chicken next time....and there will be a next time!

The crust was perfect! Thick enough for structure and substance, but thin enough to ""hide"" behind the flavors of tomato and pine nut pesto.
The cheese was also just right.

Delicious!

I also had the chicken panini, which was fantastic! The bread was a bit hard, but I think I was too busy talking and let it sit too long.

I've been here once before and had breakfast, and it might have been one of the best breakfasts in the world. I would have given it 5 stars if I wrote my review that day. 

I went yesterday for a sandwich and salad and thought it was so so at best. I was a little bummed about the instruction, or lack of instruction from the staff on how to order. It appears, and I didn't know this while ordering, that you can pick what ingredients you want to add or delete from certain sandwiches or salads. I got what I got, and it didn't exactly include what I like, or what I didn't. 

Today I would give it three stars, but since I liked the breakfast so much, I'll mix the review to give it 4 stars. Only fair. 

I'll go back and give it a try again sometime. I'm in no rush to get there, but I wouldn't avoid the place either. For breakfast, if I do want some french toast, waffles, or pancakes I'll head down to give a second shot for sure!",2008-10-07

It's almost always crowded, the layout is less than intuitive, and I've gotten questionable produce on more than one occasion. The employees are friendly enough, but it's just no comparison to other locations.

By the looks of it outside, it seems like it would be pretty large, but once you get inside it's cramped and the selections seem limited.

9446,4053,3783,"We stumbled upon this little place in a worn strip mall by accident, but it ended up being a very happy accident. 

Yes, it is true that the decor will not be gracing the pages of fashion magazines anytime soon, but this is a clean, no-frills kind of place. There is also no point in coming here if you are pressed for time, because it is not fast food by any stretch of the imagination. Most importantly, the food is good. Really good. 

The menus must have changed since other reviewers visited, because there was no Arabic on the menu. Everything is in English. I had the falafel plate and my companion had the lamb shank and rice. Both meals came with a wonderful lentil soup that I have had at Fattoush many times- but this one was so much better. The falafel plate came with falafel of course, a questionable salad, pita that looked homemade, and some of the tastiest hummus i've ever had. It was a huge amount of food, but it was so good that I was compelled to order an extra side of hummus to go with the leftovers. The lamb was apparently very tasty also- i'm not much of a lamb fan, so I didn't try it. The accompanying rice was very tasty though- very complex with many different flavors, but none of them were overwhelming. 

At 7.99 for the falafel and 9.99 for the lamb plate, the prices are more than reasonable, especially when you consider that each entree can easily end up being two meals. 

I admit that I am partial to Middle-Eastern food and rarely meet a falafel that I dislike, but this was definitely one of the better examples of the cuisine in the metro Phoenix area. I will definitely be back, and maybe next time i'll try the chicken.",2008-09-14

Service was quick and friendly.  We got in right before a rush and let me tell you, the staff were able to handle it like pros.

Each of their ice creams are homemade and you can just taste the love mixed into each one.  You can tell how proud they are of their creations.  I wont go into the kinds of ice cream they have but can tell you that whatever you choose, you will love.

8890,3912,2910,"I visited one Sunday afternoon just to check it out in reply to an ad I saw to visit for free for (5) days. Typically, when you respond to ads like that from a gym, the staff requests your information such as name, address, & phone so they can sell you on a membership later. That was not the case with me. It was very informal. I advised I was not a member and wanted to give their place a shot. The guy in the front desk said come right on in; no personal information requested and no tour. I'm glad there was no sales pressure. I thought the no tour part was kind of odd, but after doing my walk through, I understand why. The place is not very big. They have weights and cardio machines and the treadmills each had a personal television on the machine. The whole facility appeared clean and there were free towels for the taking for your workout. The lockers in the men's locker room were really nice. They were made brown wood. You can view a sample of the interior of the facility on their website. They looked really classy, but they were not free. There were cabinets offered outside of the locker rooms that you can keep your personals in with a latch that allows you to insert your personal lock on. There was also a small room for classes.

I wasn't very impressed with this gym mainly because it was very small. I came during a Sunday afternoon when most gyms don't see much traffic so I don't know what it's like during normal high traffic periods such as early mornings and after 5pm on weekdays. I would imagine that due to the small size of this gym that they cater more to the very local crowd. I wouldn't give this location a poor rating because there wasn't really anything that stood out that was negative other than the limited space and equipment. You might think of this location as the alternative to the larger chain gyms like 24 Hour Fitness, LA Fitness, or Lifetime Fitness. You can always take a look for yourself; apparently, they don't provide too much sales pressure for visitors.

I only docked a star for the (extremely) sparse decor and atmosphere...this place could have been any other type of business with just a change of sign and omission of tables...

anyway, the food was great! my fiance ordered skewers of beef and lamb(I'm not too keen on lamb, but the beef was tender and succulent...very well spiced!)...I had a cucumber salad(diced, along with onions and parsley, and soaked in vinegar-lemon juice), which enchanted me so much that I created my own version at home and make it every time I feel like doing a bit of dicing(msg me for the recipe--it's a bit death-breathy and labor-intensive but delicious!)...

and, during dessert, I could see why Samarkand was voted 'Best Tea in Phoenix'...the black tea was easily the best I've ever had(besides a special brand of blue ginger tea I make a point to keep my cabinet stocked with)...it was strong and rich...absolutely incredible!

I've had the Route 66 (Buffalo chicken) and the Ringo Starr and have enjoyed them, but it wasn't true love.  Don't get me wrong, fair choices but no real excitement.  The Sirachi chili sauce helps out- but I love that stuff.

I did not expect ceviche in AZ to be so fresh and delicious! And not only that, but they also served it with proper cancha and Inca Kola is a beverage option (which of course I had to order). 
Unfortunately, I have to give my experience 4 stars instead of 5 because they were out of Aji de Gallina, which is what my brother had his heart set on for dinner that night.

5601,2941,1203,"YogurtBuilderz provides a good sized dining area with many choices of yogurt and toppings. I did find it a little difficult to locate when I attempted to find the building - it is tucked away in the back corner of a strip mall parking lot. It was dark, late at night and took a few passes around the parking lot to zero in on the location. The staff was very friendly and the place was busy even for a Sunday night. For the staff and selection I give it a 3 star rating. It was good, but I didn't find it any different than the growing list of competition. 

I know this place is popular and self-serve frozen yogurt establishments are all the rage now. The economic model is great - you pay by the ounce and have your choice of any variety of yogurt and any topping available. Customers have the opportunity to build it as they wish, which allows those with specific tastes to have their wants fulfilled more so than a traditional store offering the generic selection of choices. 

All of that in mind, I don't like it (the industry). Too many choices creates an opportunity for indecision and slows down the lines as people stand around wondering what to put in it next. For those new to the game, you can create something that turns out to be rather nasty - for example, the white chocolate sauce is really very sweet and I find if mixed with other toppings makes it almost unbearable. The other reason I do not like these places is that I do not like to pay for food that I then have to make and serve myself. I go to restaurants and pay for a meal rather than cook it at home because a) I don't like doing it and b) I am horrific at it. While frozen yogurt does not require much preparation, there is still some assembly required. If I am paying, I prefer to have it built for me. But I realize I am in the minority.

If you don't like it crowded, go across the street to Safeway where there is no one shopping there. Then you will see a difference of why Fry's is better. Why is it so busy?

First off -- fresh local, sustainable, organic are not just words on the menu and the website. Now, in places like San Francisco and NYC, this would be nothing notable, but in the desert, it is truly something hard to find. Aside from the practical, in the land of Fox Restaurants (True aside) and the big box store at the strip mall, there really appears to be little demand for a small, local restaurant on a farm. It's time to make new demands! It's time to say no to the next Zinburgergeist and try that little corner place run by your neighbor...but I digress. 

We enjoyed the Farmer's Feast and it was worth every penny of the $65/person. First, the house cured meats, including the head cheese, were amazing. Second, how often do you get a chef's menu where each person's plate is different? Not often. Ultimately we each tried 10 different items. And each item, was amazing. I would come back for the pasta alone, let along the perfectly cooked scallops, and melt in your mouth sliced fillet. 

The service was ideal. If you want to eat in 60 minutes, don't come here, but if you want to enjoy in evening of great food, do come here. I noted to the waiter that the previous night they had sturgeon -- something I haven't seen on a menu since N. California. I commented on how unique it is, etc...Of course, it was not available on the night I was there...or was it? When it came to our fish course, the waiter brought out sturgeon for me. The restaurant didn't have enough to have it on the menu, but the waiter clearly put in a special request on my behalf and made the effort to make a diner happy. 

Maybe if I offer to work on the farm I can eat for free...",2010-01-30
6247,1275,2690,"What can you say about Beni's - Not bad and not great.

I have been to Benihana in several different cities and for a chain teppan restaurant it's ok.  My fave was in San Diego, could have been the company we were with.  I would definately say they are pretty consistant everytime we have been.  The teppan is a little pricey, the sushi is consistantly good (they also offer the all you can eat sushi), and the sake selection is ok (very average).  I do get tired of hearing the birthday song 10 to 15 times while we are dining.",2009-08-06
8011,2356,5235,"I work right down the street from Press and have been a huge fan from my very first visit! The staff is unbelievably friendly and extremely passionate about their craft! Everything from the food to the coffee is first rate! They always accommodate my special requests (a little more of this, none of that) and always make good suggestions when I'm looking for something new.
 I love the yogurt and granola parfait (strawberry and vanilla yogurt for me with a bit of honey and light granola) for breakfast with a white chocolate latte. Also, the breakfast burritos are perfectly creative and filling. For lunch, my favorite is the cactus club panini with a small side salad.
 Also worth mentioning is that they have the VERY BEST iced coffee around. They call it an iced toddy and any one of the employees would be happy to tell you how it is different from regular coffee. I just know that it tastes amazing and seems to have a bit more of a caffeine kick!
  My favorite part about Press are their delectable desserts! The berry mascarpone cake pretty much makes you feel like you've won the lottery. And the ghirardelli brownies and chocolate chip cookies (warmed up) are a weekly addiction of mine.
  Starbucks is a thing of the past. I'm lucky to be in close proximity to Press, but I think I would even make the drive just for that mascarpone cake!",2009-09-04

We especially were glad to have been given good service even though we did not order any beverages (you'd be surprised at how many servers are rude to us after they discover that we won't be ordering alcohol).

Food was good! We enjoyed: the bread, sweet and sour cabbage soup, caesar salad, baby back ribs, salmon, mashed potatoes, and creme brulee. The chopped liver at the beginning of the meal was also a nice bonus!

Only cons would be that the french fries were mundane. Also, we were a little confused about what was a part of the meal (sides, soups, etc), what was an upcharge, what we couldn't add, etc. It wasn't outlined on the menu, and our server had to explain a couple of times.

I was there today and had the $3 mimosas with the crab-cakes benedict. The potatoes that accompany the eggs are way too mealy, but the eggs themselves and the sauce are spot-on. Wished the crab-cake had a bit more flavor.

Bread service is by request only, which I really like.

5116,2532,3756,"I am definitely quite shocked at some of these reviews. I disagree with the lack of flavor, and the tasteless dishes some reviewers experienced while eating here.

 I recently moved over to the N. Phoenix area, and while craving some Vietnamese food a few months back, I decided to  browse ""Yelp"" to find it. I came across these reviews, and decided to check it out regardless of the poor comments of this establishment. I phoned in my order without looking at a menu,  ( Chicken Pho, Egg Rolls,& Spring Rolls) nor  knowing where they were even located, I eventually found it in the little nook of the Fry's shopping center. I walked in to a very tiny little restaurant  with a cute little man standing at the cash register holding my wonderfully smelling  food in hand.

 When I got home, I realized that he had forgotten to add the Noodles (which obviously is the  biggest part of this dish) I was a little miffed but eventually got over it, once I tried the appetizers we ordered,and the wonderful flavor of our pho. I knew it was such a harmless mistake so I didn't hold it against them. After consuming our wonderful and inexpensive meal I came to the realization that THIS is my new Fav Vietnamese spot in the N Phoenix area.. I've eaten their at least 5 times since I found this place in Jan. That says something in my mind!! 

In my opinion they  beat Pho Bang, and Avina HANDS DOWN!!  It's clean, inexpensive, flavorful, and definitely NOT tasteless.. A definite treat if you ask me. Speaking of which I think I'll order some now :o)",2009-04-11
7162,2414,4952,"Chain restaurant that's just about okay for afternoon dining with friends. If I wasn't having beer at lunch I'd probably suggest eating someplace else. Food is good but in my experience their beer makes the meal. I've eaten here about half a dozen times during the past few years when in town for business weekends.

It is centrally located on the corner of Mill and Fifth Street in downtown Tempe, amongst quite a few other local restaurants. During my most recent visit I ordered a steak at lunch along with one of the seasonal brewed beers. Steak was okay but I wouldn't order it again. Beer was exceptional, so I wasn't unhappy overall.

I love burgers and I think I'll stick to that as my primary choice when eating here in the future. I can't think of any times when service was particularly unsatisfactory, nor were there times when service really stood out as exceptional. I have almost always eaten here on a Saturday afternoon, and it's typically been fairly busy during the lunch hour. Never had a problem getting a table, which is important since I'm usually heading back for an afternoon conference session.

I love the big glass beer mugs (not sure what size they are) but I can't always down the whole thing during a short lunch break (I'm a lightweight).

Overall, good place to eat if you're hungry and in the downtown area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here.",2009-12-13
9665,220,3323,"A definite welcome to the neighborhood!! 

I was delightfully surprised at how much the store offers in such a small space. Grant it you are not going to get many choices on some items, but you may be surprised at some of the items you do find. There were plenty of choices for organic foods and ""green"" products, also. 

The good:
convenience - for those of you that has one in your neighborhood. Easy to get in and out of with front door parking.

PRICE - The prices are as low as Walmart's but without the hassle of having to deal with the super-store size. (they accept coupons too - even better) 

Ready meals - Great concept. Many places do this, but I found that it was easy (and fun) to create a full meal. Main courses, salads, sides, sandwiches and desserts all labeled and located in one place. If you don't have time to cook give it a shot. It is not as cheap as cooking it yourself but lasagna for two people for six bucks isn't bad. 

The bad:
Stay away from the Rotisserie Chicken. A little dry and over-cooked. I've had better at Fry's, Costco. Save your tastebuds.

In a world of Mega-stores with mega-parkiing lots it is nice to have a place that is actually cheaper to go to and within walking distance. 

The best way to describe Marketside is if you were to cram the Walmart food section and the Wholefoods quality and organic cool factor  in a space the size of Walgreens.",2008-10-21

9372,3203,6110,"ZERO stars!
I traveled from STL to SFO a few weeks ago (with a layover in PHX). I have a couple complaints;
One, I was checking 2 pieces of luggage in STL. One ended up being 14lbs. over weight (it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad). I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $35 initially for the cooler to ship (including the $25 for my first bag- so $150 total)! This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge! I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $25 like other airlines I've had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)! On top of that I paid $250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were $400 total... $100 more than my round trip ticket to fly. I couldn't believe that!
On another note, the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I've ever dealt with anywhere! She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn't allow her to fly. She raised he voice at me and called me ""a very inhumane person"" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry. I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem, including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO. This woman name-calling was totally inappropriate... people in line beside me were astonished. Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already, and she was sick of fighting with me over it, she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn't let me on the flight (and of course the gate person did).
Between the dog crate episode and the bags, I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees. I'm very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past. It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation.
I have passed the word on to as many people and websites as possible not to fly this airline!",2012-12-13

The staff is also very attentive. They check on your need often and clear out empty plates promptly. The thing that stood out most was the number of customers who are regulars.

They have some crazy ingredients like varied sauces and mayos, fresh spinach, grilled peppers, and all sorts of other things you don't see at a typical deli. Then they serve it up on a baguette, wrap, or wheat bread for about $6. The specials are particularly diverse and change daily. On the other side of the coin, their website is horrible and occasionally we find some things missing or not quite right, but we chalk that up to charm and whimsy. (We get a weekly Sacks delivery.)

If you want a basic ham and cheese sandwich, you can get that here. If you want a sandwich like their Blue Bayou, which is spicy marinated chicken served with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, cheddar jack, mushrooms, spinach, and chipotle mayo, all melted down, well, you can get that here too, but only on the days when it's a special. 

From their regular, artist-inspired menu, their Dali is an instant classic take on the egg salad: This one comes with lettuce, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, and tomato, on 12-grain bread. The Encore has prime steak, melted provolone, hot/mild/or mixed peppers, feta yogurt or marinara sauce, lettuce, tomato, and parmesan for $6.30.

Here's a clue for any of those property owners, whether you're on South Mountain, Piestewa, wherever....the guy sneaking around is the one you call the cops on for being a suspicious trespasser, not the guy driving a family suv with 2 dogs in the back, who calls you from the street as he sees you in your driveway so he can ask directions on how to get to the park entrance so he doesn't have to bother you nice people in the residential neighborhood anymore driving around here.    ah, duh.",2009-06-22

*The fact the owner/chef is present and wants to ensure you enjoy your meal.  
*Good location, plenty of parking.  
*Value, prices are in line with what I would expect to pay for the quality and type of food you get.  

Here is what was just OK:
*Service, our server was nice enough but he got distracted chatting with other employees and customers and often forgot to check back with us to refill waters, remove dirty dishes, etc.  On the plus side, he knew the menu and made excellent recommendations.
*Atmosphere, I know they are doing the best with the building they have to work with but I felt a bit like I was in a remodeled pancake house trying to be an Italian restaurant.   The one exception would be the bar area which was more elegant/traditional.

Although, when I have gone for lunch on the weekend and have asked if they can make a fish sandwich they have always accommodated me. 

I would give this place 5 star, but I think their one weakness is their brunch menu. I took a friend there for lunch because we loved their dinner and lunch menu so much, but it was very disappointing. We ordered Bloody Mary's and had to send them back because the horseradish was overwhelming. In fact, all you could taste was horseradish, no tomato juice or anything.

Raging Waters it is not. A smaller water park attached to a mini golf course it is.

Park could use a bit maintenance. Staff could use a bit of training.  Lines were very disorganized. Staff didn't have much of a clue as to what was going on. Ex:  spent our last 45 minutes waiting for the wave pool, getting into the wave pool and waiting about 15-20 minutes only for the wave pool to never come on and for the park to close.

When he came back around I ordered a specialty drink - mint and cucumber cooler or something like that - I was hoping for more cucumber than mint but the mint was overwhelming, it tasted more like a mint julep.  They did have a great selection of beers on tap but I really wanted a cocktail so the next round was a jack and coke.  

I wasn't planning to eat but I noticed some hard-boiled eggs wrapped in sausage on the HH menu, I had to try those, it's not often that I see something unique on a menu.  They were pretty good actually.

I can't wait to come back.",2012-08-21
2024,613,1696,"Went here tonight with a friend and we had a wonderful experience! We decided to start with the calamari which was just ok but I am more partial to the fried versions so that could have been part of the problem it was a little on the rubbery side and wasn't packed full of flavor. The bread that came with it though was absolutely amazing, hands down one of the best breads I have ever had. It also had a mini salad with it that had a wonderful dressing so we focused more on the bread and salad as opposed to the calamari. For dinner I decided to go with the lamb and potatoes which was 3.5/5 stars. It had decent flavor but I definitely have had better. The potatoes were very delicious though :) My friend had the duck and potatoes and it wasn't gamey and fell right off the bone which was great. It had good flavor but once again I have had better. For desert I got the pear/almond pastry(tart? can't remember) and it was absolutely amazing!! Soooo delicious and had a great balance of sweetness and was the perfect size. My friend got the blueberry and lavender desert with red cake and white chocolate which was very good as well and you could taste the lavender which was delicious but overall I don't think I would have been able to eat the entire thing myself as the sweetness level was very high.

This was a very cute restaurant and the staff was wonderful and very helpful. We had a great experience here and are looking forward to returning! I definitely recommend people try this!",2012-02-18

What really matters is that the flavor, ans salsas are still here.

I had a burrito with Mahi Mahi in it, it came loaded with spinach, mushrooms, cheese and rice. The cheese was a bit much but was still great at 10.59 with tax it should be.

What really mad it great was the salsas. Everything from a peanut salsa, to a strawberry to many of the classic favorites. I really enjoyed the roasted peepers and onions salsa.

962,786,862,"Food was good. 

I had the Choppino Fruittas de Mare. Apparently the serving is large as the server hinted that it may be too large for me, but the serving was typical for a Fruits de Mare type plate that I've had at other restaurants. Sauce was nice: spicy and good flavor. Pasta was cooked well and the right portion size, I think people add too much pasta to make the dish look larger. Other than the imitation crab (a disappointment but not a deal breaker) the seafood was cooked nicely between the calamari, mussels, etc. 

Kid's spaghetti was very good. I taste all the kid's spaghetti since I have 3 kids and invariably someone doesn't finish or even start their bowl. The pasta was cooked well, the meatball was decent, but the sauce was shick and chunky (not watery which I hate) and covered all the pasta (which for some reason other restaurants can't seem to do). There isn't a specific kid's menu but the server said they make kid's portion size of anything on the menu but the price isn't available to be seen so you have to trust they aren't going to bend you over on those, which they didn't. 

Bread, of course, was available prior to meals. The butter used is very tasty, some type of garlic I think. Bread was warm, soft, and not overcooked.

Now I would have given 4 stars except for a few exceptions: the decor and slower service. 

Decor was dreadful, sorry. Old and dated. I think their target demographics is 50 years old or greater as the chairs, pictures, and everything inside screams 1970's. The chairs remind me of an old conference hall. The lighting is on the dark side. I guess if I was out on a date or with 4 retired couples, it would be a nicer decor, but with 8 adults and 5 kids it just doesn't fit quite right.

Kid friendly not quite, but kid accomidating is more like it. Since the ambience is darker and softer volume on conversations, having loud and obnoxious kids is not the right place for them.

Overall, the food is good, servers friendly but not the family friendly place I usually prefer.",2011-12-16

7689,294,1,"I went here with a party of 4 on Saturday night and it was surprisingly dead.  Not that that's a bad thing because I don't like crowds.  The place is pretty sheik but you still feel like you're in a hotel.  Service was fast and friendly but I think it was our waiter's first night or something.  He was very awkward but it was ok.

I was pissed we couldn't get the happy hour menu/prices in the main dining room.  I know it is common practice for crowded places full of douchebags, but the bar and the main dining room were pretty empty so wtf?

I'm a vodka guy and their vodka menu is pretty neat.  They have 8 or 9 unique vodkas from around the US and clearly list their name, where they are from and the price.  What I didn't like was their martinis.  Pretty much the worst I've ever had anywhere.  Tiny pours and full of ice chips.  It was like a vodka slushy (oh snap I think I just invented something!!!).

Here is a rundown of the food:

* bread to start - excellent...love the lightly buttered and salted top
* tomato and mozzarella salad - excellent - one of the best i've ever had.  great dressing and ample balls of fresh mozzarella.
* pretzel fondue - the pretzels were excellent but the fondue and mustard were no bueno.  the fondu was gritty and the mustard lacked the kick that I love on pretzels.
* burger - pretty solid but nothing special
* mac n' cheese with Shriner's sausage - very unique and very tasty.  it was worth having once but I wouldn't get it again.
* tater tots - perfectly cooked.  salty/crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  The only thing that would have made these better is some type of aioli or other special dipping sauce other than ketchup.

The main dishes of the other people in my party looked excellent.  I should have been more adventurous and gone with something more than a standard burger.  Maybe next time. 

I was going to give this place 3 stars but I just can't.  They try to think out of the box to create dishes that are unique, have fresh ingredients, and have a local twist.  I will return.",2012-01-29

That's also what we said when some of the food came, as in ""what the hell is this??""

So positive first.  The server was pretty quick and he gave refills without being asked.  Chips and salsa were good.  Chips were warm and salsa had a nice (suprising) kick.  Kick... do I sound like an old lady? 

Morgan and I ordered fish tacos and beef tacos, respectively, so we could swap one for one.  Fish was ok... nothing spectacular... but honestly I would rather pay for one at freakin Del Taco or Rubios.  Not worth it here.  Rice was ok, some flavor, probably converted rice though.  Beans were... blended?  I dunno about you but I like to see some actual BEANS in my beans!  This stuff was like brown goo... YUMMMMMMMM... :P

The beef taco was just weird.  I swear to God is tasted like gyro meat!  WTF?  I couldn't eat much of it.  

Last but not least, Dom ordered the White Sands Chimichanga.  That sh*t looked nasty to be honest.  Covered with some gooey white sauce, filled with pork.  LOL, he said it tasted like hot dog.  Um, yikes!  He took about 2 bites and was ""full"".  A.K.A., he didn't like it.

I also had a margarita... it was HUGE and didn't taste very good.  I'd rather have one 1/4 that size that tasted nice.  Oh well.

One star for the chips and salsa.  Like I said, the fish taco was okay, but every thing was just way over-priced!

I can't remember what we had our first visit, it was right after they opened and during the awkward stage. The second visit we had pizza it was good, we were looking for deep dish which they don't make but it was good and great service. 

Tonight we all had different things: Mostaccioli for my older son he was very happy, cheesy and flavorful sauce. Spaghetti and meatball off the kid's menu for the younger boy, sweet sauce and a big meatball another happy boy. Husband had the Chicago Grinder hot and it was gone in a flash and he said it was really good. It looked great on the toasted bread. He also got a salad instead of fries, lots of fresh veggies. I had the Italian Beef with peppers and onions, it comes with Giardiniera and au jus and french fries. The bread was yummy soft yet substantial enough to withstand au jus. The bread was stuffed, stuffed with meat, the peppers and onions were good but the giadiniera made it. It was a really good sandwich. San Tan Brewery on tap - yum.

On a positive note, the prives were good and the salsa they serve with store-bought chips wasn't bad. And the lemonade (they were out of most flavors both times I visited) was good.

I'm not one of those people that knows the names of each and every dish. As I write this I'm kicking myself for not taking notes. As a whole, the buffet was a-ok. Nothing in particular knocked my socks off. I did notice that nothing was powerfully flavorful. It was kind of a ""safe"" seasoning restaurant. I would visit Flavors of India again.

I asked the woman at the counter if I could have some very minor stitching done on a cloth purse. She looked it over for about 3 seconds and said 'Oh no I don't see how this could be repaired'. (what I wanted sewn were two little pom poms attached to the cloth strap that were loose and I wanted them to be stitched on there tighter). Not a difficult task. She then told me that she could maybe 'send it out' and have it stitched but it would take a week or more to get it back. WHAT??!
I then asked her about  the skirt which I wanted cleaned and/or pressed with the tags attached (because I'm selling it). She said no that the tags would be destroyed in the process.

Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.

The soup was ok (bland, but ok), the sandwich was...well, kind of sad looking. A big dark green piece of wilted lettuce, barely any of the 'cranberry mayo' or whatever was supposed to be the mayo on there, the turkey and ham tasted great...there just wasn't very much of it, and they completely forgot my request for a side of mayo, mustard and a knife/fork on a triangle cut piece of wheat bread. I wasn't able to choose my chips, so ended up with some plain ones and my cookie was undercooked by about 10 minutes. The outer circle was baked, but the rest was cookie moosh.

It's Beer Week in AZ this week and they had just hosted a SanTan event (pub crawl) today as part of Beer Week, so they were understandably out of SanTan Devil's Ale and the place was quite quiet when we arrived at 5pm.

Alright, so we ordered burgers as we were both in the mood for a sizable piece of beef, hopefully topped with bacon and other yummies.  They did a pretty good job for being a sports bar, but not impressive. They claim their meat is fresh ground, though when that's the case, the patty has a different type of form and is less flat and compacted.. okay, maybe they grind it in the AM and then stockpile patties for the day.. that's fine.  The bacon (I ordered the #9 All Star - cheddar, bacon, beef) was lame... thin, a bit stale-tasting, and not crispy.  The cheese was fine.  I did like that the meat was char-broiled and so it has a good taste to it.  Also, the inside wasn't over cooked and the bread they served it on was kinda sweet and giant... tasty, actually.

The sides were blaaaah.. cole slaw was really boring and had literally 3 ingredients (white cabbage, carrots, sugary mayo) something I would expect from Chili's or Denny's.

Well, the burger hit the spot but the rest was plain and boring.  The Stella was not as cold as I prefer.  Our staff was very good.  So far, an OK place to visit, but a 4 star place is somewhere I will likely go out of my way to visit.. this didn't make the cut.",2012-02-19

We headed out for Postino Central for their wine and bruchetta special on a Tuesday and were disappointed to find out there was an hour wait.   So we headed up central looking for an alternative. I saw Hula and remembered I've wanted to try it for while, so that's where we ended up.  I started with a blood orange martini and sweet potato fries.  The martini was awesome, but I have to say the fries had potential, but they weren't crispy.  For dinner I had the Jamaican jerk tofu.  It was pretty flavorful and the corn cakes and plantains that came with it were a nice addition.   The meal was good, the service was great and the overall ambiance was chill yet urbane.  It wasn't the best place I've ever been, but I'll definitely go back.

8073,3151,2829,"This place is the white-trash Chipotle. The food is mediocre at best. I mean seriously, how can you just up and steal Chipotle's idea! There's no creativity there. The Habenaro Salsa is flavorless and not hot at all. Seriously? I asked for HOT, not some yellowish tomato concoction for the people who can't handle real salsa!  At least Chipotle has hot salsa (not too hot either but much better) for a fast Americanized mexican food. Of course I much rather have the real deal but I do like Chiptole for what it is. Not this crap that Qdoba tries to serve up. 
The chicken is over seasoned and highly spiced/herbed you can barely taste the chicken. The Fajita veggie were the same. The product looked of very low quality. Oxidizing Guacamole and Lettuce. The meat looked unappetizing as well. Just not at the level of Chipotle. Although I have been here twice, this is the last time for me. I have been to one in Denver and for some reason thought it was better. So maybe it's management but I can say the food is less than good. I much rather go to Chiptole than this wannabe!

The feet are big (the feet are the rim of the cookie) and the cookie body itsself is airy and thin whereas a true macaron is light but doesn't actually have air pockets in it (the cookie dough is still present throughout).

Our group of friends hadn't seen each other for a while.   Busy catching up, we didn't open our menus for quite a while.  I was impressed that our waitress (her name might be Mel) kept coming back in the nicest way to check on us, but didn't interrupt our conversation.   She kept letting us know that she was ready when we were.  

When we were finally ready to order, she asked:  ""Separate checks?""   Terrific.  That was exactly what we needed.

I hadn't expected to like the food, because I had heard and read that it was all the  high-calorie ""comfort"" variety.   It was a nice surprise that I was able to get low-calorie substitutions for the sides that went with my entree.

The food is Outstanding and I've liked everything except the Catfish fried. My wife enjoys the catfish, but I think its lacking flavor, however they fry it to a cripy golden brown crust. I could just eat the crust and forget the fish. 

We've been twice now and I'm sad to say that we pretty much ordered the same things twice. The garlic parmesan wings and honey habenero wings are our favorites (of course we haven't tried any others, so take it with a grain of salt) catfish, corn nuggets, fried okra, french fries, and coleslaw. And to finish it all off...the best Biscuits of all time, if you consider a biscuit a French dougnut.(beignet) a biscuit. Seriously the best thing ever, but you feel pretty guilty afterwards.

We brought it to the attention of our waitress, who brought the manager Adrienne over.  They both apologized profusely and took the charges off of our bill, which is what I would expect.  We were polite and appreciative of their apology and really didn't expect or ask for anything else.  However, they also offered to give us a credit to come back another time so they could prove to us that it was just a one time mistake.

We took them up on the offer, and sure enough the food was excellent the second time around.  Our server was fantastic, Adrienne came by to make sure we were happy, and the chef even came out to make sure we were pleased with the meal.

Nails sanded too thin and they talk to other people and look away while they'e filing, sanding and cutting.  They cut two times now into the side of my thumb nail, which causes it to catch and tear off the same day, or soon.  Their 10 or 12-yr old daughter brought the colors to pick (she is much too precocous to be customer focused--she's narcisstic and I want an adult waiting on me).

I tried one of the specials, the Hunan Smoked Pork. It was basically kind of like bacon stir-fried with fresh vegetables with a spicy Hunan black bean sauce. I love bacon and I really liked this dish. My wife had prawns w/vegetables, we liked the freshness of the vegetables and generous amount of prawns but overall the dish was slightly bland. She liked it but thought that it would have been better with the lobster sauce. We were mixed on the iced tea, my wife felt it was too strong but I thought it was fine.

5615,2480,4043,"Ok, I hesitated writing a review of this place because I like that it's not busy, but I want the place to survive because I enjoy it so much. 

I hate gyms...I mean LOATHE them. From rude staff to unpleasant odors or creepy guys giving you longing looks while you're just trying to figure out which one of your friends with an advanced degree in engineering you can text to help you figure out how to get on a machine without having it rip your arm out of its socket because the staff is not going help you without paying for a personal trainer or because you don't look like you were already born on a nautilus machine. 

This gym is everything but. I went in because of the great introductory special and a recommendation of a friend. We're both training to swim the SF Bay for the 2011 Sharkfest Alcatraz Swim, so we needed a pool. 

As soon you walk in, the guy at the front desk treats you like you're an old buddy and cracks jokes like he is your best bar buddy. Awesome attitude. The place has never been overly crowded (even at peak hours right after work. I've never gone during the early morning or lunch hours).

No waits on the machines and they have plenty of them. No waiting in the pool and even when there is a water aerobics class, one lane is left open to due laps. Hot tub, sauna, and some inexplicable walk in dunking tub (see, I'm not a gym aficionado or else I would know what that thing is for).

Towel service, locks, and even gym shorts available. (no more using that excuse that you can't work out today because you left your work out clothes at home...they have some to check out there.)

Even the seemingly cranky old lady doing her water workout was nice and called me sweetie and asked if I was ok when I inadvertently let out a puppy like whimper as my shoulder blades decided they wanted to cede from the union of my body. Note to self....don't do a month of the P90X with a friend, think you're hot stuff and on your way to a gym bod and then jump in a pool to do a mile swim without stretching because you think you're all that now. Had it not been for Grandma Water Aerobics, I might still be at the far end of the pool trying to inch my way back to the stairs hoping that the water on my face hid the tears that were going start gushing any minute if I couldn't make it to the hot tub to get my back to stop seizing up.  (Thank you, unknown Water Aerobics lady. You turned a moment of shame into motivation. Oh yeah, I will out swim grandma next time!)

The place is in the basement of an office building next to the seemingly abandoned Chateaux on Central development. Central and....Encanto (?) 
You can park on the street (careful of the meters) or use the garage. The gym validates. 

There is a downstairs weight room (I haven't check it out yet as I because there is a free gym at my job.) Yes, I like this place so much, I am paying for a gym membership even though I have access to work out facilities for free in my own building....including free personal trainer....but instead I get in my car come 5pm and drive to a gym I pay for because this athletic club is worth it. 

I saw no young kids running around. The clientele seems to be early  30s and up, young urban professionals and some retirees who are just trying to stay healthy. No creepy people ogling you (which you may be looking for) and no rude gym bunnies laughing at you in your leotard on the treadmill....but really....you shouldn't have the leotard and hot pink leg warmers on anyway...it is 2010.  But hey, to each his own.",2010-10-21

3432,2136,2681,"Steakhouses are competitive today and the typical Yelper probably has his or her favorite.  My good friend and I were eager to see the type of energy that the new investors have injected into a local legend, the Wigwam in Litchfield Park. 

As time was flying by, in the last 10 years, the AZ Kitchen (also in the Wigwam Resort) closed for dinner.  This southwestern gem was also affectionately called the 'Snake Pit' by a friend but the service was top notch and it was one of the earlier restaurants that provided full view of the kitchen by diners.  The Wigwam's ballroom dining has now been converted to Red's Steakhouse. 

Service started out well with a nice touch of a choice of fruit for your water.  The waiter had recommendations but also allowed us time to ponder the menu.  We opted for the couple's dinner, essentially a prix fixe with a salad, choice of sea bass or steak, and the shared dessert.  We also decided to try the crab cake appetizer - just to adventure through the menu a bit; this resulted in a stern warning from the waiter that the steaks were 14 ounces. 

The crab cake was a nice presentation with fresh crab and a toasted crunchy top and colorful spinach bottom.   The side avocado dressing was a bit heavy for the crab and appeared similar to the faux guacamole at cheaper eateries.  However the crab was dry and the waiter brought more of this dressing out for us. 

The service with the Caesar salad presentation began to falter. The salad is the craze of serving entire stalks of the romaine and a toasted slice of bread.  Reminding the waiter for salt and pepper, he promptly provided a set and advised us the salt was also in a grinder. My friend determined that the pepper grinder was broken and did not provide a coarse grind and the waiter asked if we would like another pepper grinder.  Actually, for the prix fixe price of $45, I really wanted the waiter to politely grind the salt and pepper over our salads.  The crouton had no flavor. 

Our steaks were done as ordered but the NY Strip did not have a lot of flavor. The menu indicates the meat is grilled at 1600 degrees. However, my medium rare steak really appeared to be grilled on my a standard grill with no caramelizing or searing to hold in the rare juices. The steaks were true to size of waiter's tip. 

The steaks were served with two asparagus stalks which appeared to be white asparagus with green tips, a unique veggie for the plate. 
An au gratin potato patty also accompanied the steak and was quite yummy. 

As the server boxed up our plates, they brought out a raspberry mouse.  Its flavor did not impress either of us but my girlfriend did find the mascarpone center and it was addictive. 

Service was not astute nor attentive and sometimes baffling.  We were just into the meal when the waiter dramatically closed the drapes of the window near us. One of the other diner's called out in sadness to lose the evening sun but the waiter shushed her and said they would be opened intermittently to avoid blinding other diners. Could Red's should consider awnings or subtle window shades to preserve our dining views? 

The Wigwam may not be hoppin' just yet; but  as we left the restaurant, the three restaurants on Old Litchfield Road - outside the gates of the resort - were busy as locals may have enjoyed more reasonable fare and better service.  These restaurants are our next adventure!",2010-08-01

This location was, well, let's just say, it wasn't crowded.  And it showed in the service, very nice and attentive.  They were very patient when our party was supposed to be 8 people, then ballooned to 12 people, then 13.  Unfortunately, one of the solutions to accommodate us was to put a couple of square tables 'attached' to our eight person round table.  I *hate* this.  It's just awkward for at least half the people, and then the people that get stuck at the 'junction'...sucks...

We ordered some apps, though the only one I tried was the saganaki.  It was definitely good and the pita bread that it came with was nice and warm.  For a meal, I ordered a gyro pita.  Now, I understand that this is a 'full' greek restaurant, and maybe I shouldn't have gone with a gyro, BUT, that's what I was in the mood for, and being a basic greek food, shouldn't be hard to make a good one right?  Well, apparently not.  I've probably gotten gyros at ten places around town, and this was definitely the worst one I've had.  The pita wasn't particularly warm and the meat was kind of tough.  The tzatziki was fine, but thought it was a little weird to be on the side.

The service was good and patient, but the lame decision to combine two different kind of tables (when we suggested moving and pushing several squares together) knocks them down a little bit.  Though not as much as the not good gyro.  Probably closed to a 2.5, but rounded down to 2.",2009-07-18

Our table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes. No one bothered to offer us drinks, and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers. When our waiter came, he did not even apologize for the wait, and we gave our orders: drinks, appetizers, and pita sandwiches.

The hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly, only twenty minutes later. Both were alright, but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips, and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita. We asked our waiter for extra pita, and he kindly agreed. The entire duration of dinner, it never came.

Refills were also a pain, as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter, and he wouldn't come until ten minutes later.

An hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches. I've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour. Half the tables outside already left, including tables that arrived after us, and we were the last ones served. The food was of average quality, and I've been to better with cheaper prices.

Slightly expensive, I can see as justified. But many agree that time is worth much more than money. I had an excessive amount, over an hour and a half, wasted on a decellerating Sunday night. Staff is kind of nice, but I suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself aren't immediately turned off. I can say for certain that I'm never coming here again, and I'll find myself at better places much closer to home.",2009-07-26

2568,1082,2092,"Stayed here with my girlfriend for a Radiohead show and a get away weekend from work.  Got the hotel for the amenities which were great, we played tennis, enjoyed the fantastic people watching at the pool, great cocktails to include the Tequila Sunrise, and some light putt putt outside our cottage.  The room was not ready when we got there so we got a cottage which was supposed to be an upgrade with a semi private patio.  The room was actually very nice and had a great tv which we might have watched for a grand total of 30 minutes in 4 days.  Our room was made up between 4-5 each day that we planned to stay there and then on the day we plan to check out, they came by at 8:30....not sure what the problem was there.  We also had to call about our A/C after we sweated the first night but it was fixed and no problems after that so maybe it was just a glitch which happens.  You are probably wondering what if anything was wrong, the only issue we had was the concierge.....nightmare, no help whatsoever.  Called several times, both girlfriend and I and got the reply on two separate occasions to just check google.  I have stayed at less nice hotels and had much better service with concierge, this hotel should realize what their clients might be interested in and do some research.  

All in all, great trip and a nice and above par stay.  I would certainly stay here again if I can get my girl to go with me!",2012-03-28
3947,1750,3012,"beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you don't drink tea?  really.

The crazy thing is, i'm sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill?

When I mentioned it to the cashier, she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  ""oh, is this your 1st time?  we can remove it from the bill""

I said forget it, keep it.

i usually tip 20-30% but i'll just let them keep their meager 65 per charge.

  yeah, really worth losing a customer for?

my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water.

gone are the $2.15 per item flat rate (can you say bait and switch?)

$2.35 PER so now they're no different from the rest of the dim sum places.

as sneaky as C-FOO trying to strong arm the 15% gratuity (which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers)

so in a down economy, you're supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges?

it's the chinese way i guess

The food, however, is pretty tasty.  They have a wide variety of items typical to Middle Eastern cuisine: shawarmas, falafel, kebabs, pies, and more.  They heat items up in an open oven and the food comes out very fresh and hot!

I tried the cheese pie and shawarma.  Both items were very good.  I still got onions when I asked for them to be excluded.  I suggest skipping their small beverage options in the adjacent cooler and going to the selection on the south side of the store for a better deal and variety.

Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.  
When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.

The brisket also had a very dark pink smoke ring and good smoky flavor. the bbq sauces are good but nothing special. The platters come with 2 side dishes and I was pleasantly surprised that the veggies were not boiled to death.

In fact, I usually end up at Green with non-vegetarian friends because they claim that it's ""Food you can eat that I actually like."" Every dish is addictive, flavorful, saucy, and filling. Classic hits include the chicken thai peanut bowl, the singapore tofu bowl (although the mock meats are a shame to miss out on), the vegan BBQ chicken sammich (I just watched a carnivorous friend down this with the delight and voracity of a young velociraptor), and then there are the eternally awesome specials.

Even though you'll probably be stuffed post-meal... make room for dessert. It's mind over matter anyway. Order a Tsoynami - they're like McFlurries with vegan ice cream and epic swirl ins. Standouts include Tsoynamis  filled with anything from frozen chocolate fudge, bananas, kitkats, hazlenut brittle, mint oreos and more.

I thought I'd try out another store to avoid wearing out my welcome on Bell Rd., and I'm glad I did.

This is a clean, efficient operation.  The building's pretty new, with a large dining area full of a variety of walled areas and nooks and crannies, giving many of the tables a private feel.
There's even a big atrium window, and a real, live 15' or so ficus tree growing indoors out of the floor in the dining area.  Great atmosphere for this kind of place.

The service was quick and friendly.  I could tell that the young guy at the counter thought the manager barking orders was being a dick, but he took it in stride, smiling and saying ""yes, sir"" the whole time.  ""richard"" the manager was only doing what it takes to keep a FF store running smoothly, though, and young guy will someday get a job selling cars or something, and look back thankfully on all 'richard' taught him about  upselling and add-ons, smiling and being friendly.

Got the #4 lunch chopped pork sandwich with beans and a lemonade and it came out very quickly. Possibly because the beans were Bush's or the like? They tasted like canned baked beans heated up in a microwave. Not cool. The sandwich was ok at best. Thinking back on Stacy's, Honey Bear's, and other great BBQ spots, this one was not even in the same arena. I'll have to go back though and try a sandwich with the correct sauce on it. There was one sauce on the table which after reading reviews here I had assumed was the BBQ sauce. It looked a little watery but I thought whatever its NC style, and it may have been because it was a bit vinegary. On the way out I noticed every other table had a red sauce labeled BBQ, so I guess they have two different ones. I would have preferred the red one I assume. 

There was no atmosphere, the place was run down (doesn't appear to have been remodeled after Shish Kabob House vacated) and was generally a dirty feeling place.

There were only two of us so we had a limited sample of the menu, but everything was topnotch.  We tried the baked goat cheese appetizer and were wowed by the creaminess of the melted cheese, the piquant flavor of the tomato salsa, and the crunchy toasted baguette to spread all the goodness on. This is a winner... just go ahead and order it and you'll thank me later!

Dining partner got the Red Wine Braised Beef sandwich, with the Red Quinoa side salad. Now I must tell you, I was all over quinoa ten or fifteen years ago, before it got real trendy, and cooked it often... but always had it hot, sort of as a substitute for rice in dishes where you'd use rice.  Never ran across a recipe for it to be used cold, in a salad...

9888,4152,199,"I brought DD and her friend here today after a long day of Summer Camp and running around.  

We showed up shortly before 3 p.m. for their Pop In Playtime, which is supposed to be from 10 am to 5 pm.  

There are two rooms of bouncy house contraptions that are appropriate for children older than age 3.  I don't know if they have actual age or size restrictions, but kids younger (and/or small kids) would have a difficult time here.  One reason it would be hard for younger kids?  There are specific instructions for the contraptions which they go over with the kids before they are allowed inside.  Some have a max of 2 kids at a time (the obstacle courses), some have a max of 6.  One has a max of four, with three on the ladder and one going down the slide.  Younger kids would likely need to be constantly reminded of the rules, as they can be a little rigid.

Both my 4 year old and the 9 year old LOVED it here.  They both said they preferred it to Jumpstreet.  

The girls were bummed out when at ten minutes to 4 someone came in and said playtime would be ending in ten minutes.  Then the guy said if parents wanted to know why, we could approach him.  Upon approaching him, he said that two birthday parties were booked for 4 p.m., so they were ending Pop In Playtime early.  

Some parents were VERY upset, having just gotten there less than 30 minutes prior.  DD was very disappointed.  It took a little prodding to get her to put her shoes back on and get ready to leave after only an hour of playing.  

On the way out, some parents stopped by and talked to the shift manager.  She just handed out cards for another session since ours was cut short.  Pretty cool; we will use the cards to bring another neighborhood kid back with us.

There were JUST the right amount of kids here at this time of the day.  I cannot imagine how nuts it must be here on a weekend or during Summer mornings.

While in the waiting area I flipped through Dr. Ito's ""Smile"" book that shows some of his work.  WOW!  He makes teeth look real, not like Chiclets.  He does some fabulous cosmetic work!  

I went in to have a crown put on and it was quick and painless. So quick that I didn't get to finish watching the movie!   Each chair has headphones and a flat screen that shows a movie (he keeps a good stock of the latest movies.).  Who'd have thought that going to the dentist would keep me so entertained?

I've had to bring my son to each appointment as I haven't had anyone to keep him.  Does that matter? Nope.  Dr. Ito's office is equipped with a children's area in the back where the kids can watch a movie, read a book or play a game.  He thinks of everything.

I have been recommending him to everyone I meet.  I can't say enough good things about Dr. Ito and his staff.  You won't regret going to the dentist if Sonoran Hills Dental is your new dental office.",2011-03-22

My standards for quality froyo are high since I frequent Yogurtology (Shea and Scottsdale), Yogurtland (I'm the Duke in Scottsdale), and sometimes I go to Mojo in Tempe. 

This place has ""ok"" flavors. I had the original tart, that was quite a bit tart. The toppings are ok. My friend really liked the fact that they have banana chips, but that's because we usually eat our froyo at home and we were far away from home, and she didn't have to use her personal stash. 

Since it made her happy, I gave this place an extra star. I'm cool like that.

Hmm...let's see. They have a snow machine. Not really sure what this is for. It seems out of place. 

It's far from my house, and not really worth my drive. I guess if it was by my house, and I had no other options, I'd frequent this business.

1833,1336,1551,"I purchased the introductory groupon they offered a few weeks ago, and was hesitant at first because I haven't had the greatest experiences using groupons.  I was pleasantly surprised.

I did look at some of the bad yelp reviews before going in, which made me nervous! So for those of you that only look at bad reviews, I hope you see this one and have a little more hope.

I had a stylist named Annie, she had pink hair.  Super friendly, and really appeared to want to get my style right.  Since I had read bad reviews before coming in about stylists not listening to the customer when they asked for the curling iron to be used for better curl, I was concerned she would do the same.  But, I let her know I was looking for good curl, and with thin/straight hair, it can be tricky to achieve.  She attempted to curl with just the round brush and hair dryer first, and when she was ""impressed by her curling abilities with a round brush,"" she was ""equally impressed with my hair's inability to hold a curl."" So she broke out the curling iron!

We made great small talk, and I let her know I would be back in a month when I go out to celebrate my birthday.

The salon is a fun, well-decorated environment.  It was pretty loud with the hair dryers going, but not terrible.  The less than perfect rating was that I saw people with mimosas/champagne, and while I had been offered something to drink, I figured I could just choose water or coffee, as that is usually is what at hair salons, I wasn't informed of my choices by the front desk staff.  Now I know for next time to ask for some bubbly!

Another good tip is to plan for longer than 45 minutes if you are planning to do a style with curls.  While I got started on my appointment about 5-10 minutes late, I was there for 1 hour (and I dont have super long, thick hair that takes a great deal of time).

I will be back in January for my 25th birthday night!",2012-12-26

The staff was friendly (they actually SMILED).

9181,3458,6009,"As a visitor to Scottsdale, I thought a stroll through the farmers market was a great way to get a taste of the local flavor--literally. And it was! There's a great mix of vendors, who sell everything from baked goods to coffee, from vegan wraps to preserves. There are also some interesting services like pet massages!

Like Vicky T. said, it was surprising to see dogs with their owners wandering through the farmers market, because that's against code in California. But I thought it was great, and with the pet masseuse and a doggy and kitty treat vendor, it totally made sense.

Farm Sessions, where local chefs give cooking demos with produce from the market, is a great idea I'd like to see at my local farmers market. It did seem odd, though, that all the produce at the market was in one corner. It was the shadiest spot, so maybe that's why?

Anyway, this was a great way to spend a Saturday morning and was very relaxing compared to my local farmers markets, where I often feel like I need to start throwing some elbows to get through the crowd.",2010-02-28

Beyond that the food is awesome! I go with my fiance and we love the calamari and the garlic bread, which we always get as appetizers.

8764,934,5792,"Summary: not impressed.

Arrived early afternoon, ironically maybe that was the problem - there wasn't enough going on, place was dead. I would have hoped that a restaurant manager would realize that the few customers they may have at a slow time are just as important as those on a Friday night rush - standards are standards, you either have them or you don't.

Waitress was pleasant but not attentive - with a total of 3 occupied tables had to get up and get her attention for more chips. Chips though were very good; needed hotter salsa.

My friend had the steak fajitas; tasted OK but just luke warm. Fajitas are supposed to be sizzling hot; duh.

I had a so-so tamale and chicken enchilada. Enchilada was just warm, mostly a flat layer of cheese. Tamale filling was tasty shredded meat (as it should be) but corn meal was barely warm and almost tasted only partially cooked. Refried beans weren't warm enough to even melt the grated cheese sprinkled on top, which consequently then pulled off in a single congealed mass when I took a bite. 

Finally, the Cadillac margaritas were just average at best. 

$50 plus tip for two meals plus two margaritas; not worth it.

The place looked promising and has a cute patio area but we won't be back - someone's not watching the store. I'm trying to be generous with the two stars as some other Yelpers seem to like this place; maybe things can get better.",2012-12-07

I have since opted for someplace closer but often miss conversing with Scott about working out with his Ultimate Fighting friends. He often had the bruises to prove it. 

Art would generally blow dry my hair making it slightly poofy and not unlike his own Frankie Avalon style, but once I got home and styled it on my own, the cut was perfect.

Mrs. Lovato, whose first name I really wish i could remember, always offered some ice cold lemonade while I waited and I always felt like an honored guest. 

Scotts kids can often be found sweeping the floors in the summer and they are about the cutest things you will ever see.

This place is some serious mexican food. Not the fancy stuff, the good, mexican-at-home style. It's good at 6am, lunch, dinner, midnight, and even the 2am drunk-I'm-hungry meal. I have three favorites here.

1. Bean and cheese burrito w/sour cream - the beans are refried with good ol' grease. It's delicious and the cheese is legit cheddar.

2. Super Nachos - I don't understand how you can not finish this one. They give you a ridiculous amount of chips with a mexican buffet on top, but once you get the hot sauce on it, you can't stop.

3. Carne Asada burrito, no pico, with sour cream and Guacamole - Cooked fresh on the grill and wrapped in the biggest tastiest flour tortilla. They even will sell you the tortillas by themselves if you ask.

The only downside to this eatery is their lack of seating space during the lunch rush hour.  Get there by 11am if you actually want to sit inside, otherwise on a windy and cold winter day you might find yourself outside sitting on the patio (as I have done in the past.)

3488,211,2717,Good Date Night Spot!!!  Went here the other night for dinner and it was really good. I had the steak and my wife had the casa dilla of the day.  Both were cooked to perfection.  Sometimes nicer places have really small portions and seem to pay more attention to how pretty the dish is instead of how good it is but this place was spot on with both presentation and taste. We did not have a reservation so we sat at the bar which has full menu service.  The bar wraps around and near the men's restroom there is some additional bar seats that nobody sits at.  I thought this area might have been a little more private than some of the two person tables.  I also thought it was cool to be able to see into the kitchen but that might only be appealing to me.  The bartender was very knowledgeable and checked on us several times during our meal.

It's a fabulous hub of culture, but the food concessions need some urgent attention. The only munchies they have are desserts like cookies or pies, so be sure to have dinner first.

1303,1018,1135,"Everyone knows about Pei Wei right?! I really thought so until my boyfriend admitted that he had never been. Challenge accepted. 

Now, I've been a frequent Pei Wei customer ever since I discovered Asian food did not always have to send to you running to the restroom. (Yeah, thanks for nothing Bing Heng and Great Wall Buffet). This isn't the best Asian food ever, but it is quick, accessible, and always pretty tasty. 

I've tried everything on the menu, but my favorite options are the Crab Wontons and the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken. I ordered these plus the Spicy Korean for my n00b boyfriend to try, and everything went better than expected. 

In fact, he even commented that the place was ""classier"" than he expected.

5351,2865,3896,"Yelper Jane B's review is remarkably similar to what I intended to include in my review.

We've stayed at close to a dozen different Homewood Suites over the years and this one left us wishing we could have stayed at any of the others instead.

Furnishings were adequate but not terribly comfortable.  The living room had a sleeper sofa and a side chair, a dining table with two chairs, an end table, a coffee table, and a TV stand with 3 drawers plus the kitchenette, all in a room roughly 9' x 14'.

The bedroom contained a desk with 3 drawers (serving also as the dresser) and the bed and nightstands.  The desk also served as the TV stand, allowing a small work area and taking up so much room the door couldn't swing all the way open.

Our bedroom also contained the mystery deadbolted closet with unknown contents, which took up half the guest closet space.

The bathroom was large but dingy and dimly lit.

I considered renting an on-demand movie one evening, but everything offered by the hotel was $15+/each (!!) and since there wasn't a DVD player we didn't have the opportunity to rent somewhere more reasonable and bring it back to our room.  Free wifi seemed stable although a bit slow, and the pool was small but the kids didn't seem to mind.

The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was well-prepared and always had enough variety to keep the kids and adults happy.

We got a great rate but hey, it's Scottsdale in the summer so most rates are pretty darn good.  Normally we enjoy staying away from home, but after 6 nights here even the kids were anxious to get home.

We'll stay at Homewood Suites again in the future, but not this one.",2012-06-19

""World Famous Sliders""? These were the worst sliders ever, I think Jack and the Box sliders are better. Almost $10 for six southwestern sliders with a patty the size of a half dollar that got lost in the bun, one jalapeno, a small square of cheese, and salsa to make the bun soggy.

5469,2169,3960,"Pretty good mexican grub in the 480.

I had two carne asada tacos and a chile rellano plate.

The meat in the tacos was tender, tasty and plentiful, accompanied by chilantro, onion and hot sauce - typical ingredients but done right.

The chile rellano had a flavorful red sauce, the batter was not too soggy, the chile was cooked well (not crunchy/underdone, not squishy/overcooked) and the cheese oozed out when the chile was cut into.  This dish came with the standard rice and beans, neither of which was remarkable in any way shape or form.

Minus two big stars for what they consider guacamole.  It wasn't thick, it had no taste and it seemed as though this vital mexican staple was merely there as a garnish.  No bueno.  If it ain't green, thick and tasty, you better hit the drawing board.

574,495,530,"If Star of India (SoI) is named after the historic ship that set sail from Great Britain to India then it is best to declare at the beginning that there is nothing worth remembering about this place and there is little that keeps you afloat in the morass of ordinary fare. 

Like many other Indian restaurants in the valley, the smell of Indian cooking hangs in the air and permeates every piece of furnishing. The place does not disappoint when it comes to service, it is warm, quick and attentive. The complimentary papadums (Indian flatbread) with homemade chutneys (condiments) is usually the high point of a meal at SoI. 

Experiences with the order could be as follows: 
Gobi Parantha (Indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- The real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the SoI parantha resembles a topping-less thin crust pizza. 
Lamb korma- The gravy is thick, nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre-cooked. 
Chicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the God-food that is biryani but SoI manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables. 
Disheartenment with the over-priced, sub-standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert. 

Finally, as observed in other reviews and the menu, if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and Chef's specialities. However in that case the excitement of an extensive menu will be lost.",2009-03-09
1640,1229,1395,"The Saguro is a bright, happy place in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale and I, for one, am a big fan of bright, happy places (people, too but that's a story for another time.)

It is set up more like an apartment and less like a hotel with lots of buildings scattered about, all surrounding a pool. (There is actually more than one pool to make this happen.) It definitely has more of a party vibe than some hotels, which is just fine by me. I can imagine during the summa, summa, summertime these pools are hopping. 

And, even though the feel of the place is fun, the staff of the place is nothing less than professional. Every single person I interacted with was beyond kind, helpful, and happy.

Whether you need a hotel room for a night or a full trip, a place to hang out poolside, a happy hour cocktail, a casual meeting place, or breakfast or lunch I think The Saguaro just might have you covered. And all with a smile.

7127,3418,4932,"Welcome to the funkiest place in Goodyear. If you've been craving sheet-metal winged pigs but regretting that Cave Creek is practically a day trip from the west valley, you may feel tempted to lie on the floor and weep tears of joy.

This Armadillo provides fine circuit training for working off breakfast at the Black Bear Diner, including a loft with moderately steep stairs. Like its cousin up toward Metro Center, it's an ""antique mall"" in the sense of focusing mostly on vintage items and less uncommon antiques, plus a smattering of ""collectibles."" This is the kind of antique mall I prefer, since it really functions as a sort of fantasy department store for shoppers who have a middle-of-the-road budget but whimsical or retro tastes.

Like the other Armadillo, stock here runs somewhat more to the frilly and ornate than to the mid-century modern, but it's not a total lock-out of swellness in favor of sweetness. Unlike the other one, there's a larger variety of dealers who aren't typical antique-mall fare: things like reproduction hardware, the aforementioned sheet-metal winged-pigs, repro tin signs, garden ornaments made from vintage dishes. This isn't my cuppa, but in context, it provides useful variety, and it fills booths (there are more empty booths here, but it's still fairly new).

A number of dealers seem to actually be replicated here, including the scrapbook store. Also replicated is the cheery professionalism of the operation: clean restrooms, occasional seating areas, efficient check-out, and available snacks.

I love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait-staff, and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary.

I ordered the Fillet Mignon. Yummy!! Everything on the menu looked so good. Frank & Albert's also had a great wine list. My work colleagues were very happy with my dinner choice.

I'm a big fan of a good Italian Beef sandwich.  I was introduced to it when I lived in the Chicago area in 2001.  Since I've moved back to AZ, I am always in search of a good one.  Lately, on my way to Anaheim for a little family fun, I stop at Portillo's in Buena Park or Moreno Valley.  This is a must.  Needless to say this is what I compare Italian Beef sandwiches to.

The Italian Beef sandwich at Al's just did not compare.  Not only was the beef dry even though I got it wet, but it just tasted different.  It was definitely an unexpected taste for me.  The rest of the family agreed too.  The hype was there but did not deliver or meet my expectations for me.

To top it off, the service wasn't the best either.  It took a few times for the cashier to get the order right.  And even though the order was right they still managed to screw up one of the items we ordered.  Though they did rectify it.  And to top it off, we ordered a ""chopped"" salad.  The lettuce wasn't even chopped.  What?  Not chopped?  It's the little things.

Their patio is pretty big and mostly shaded.  This wasn't a day to be too concerned about shade, since it wasn't hot out.  I read the reviews ahead of time and already knew what I wanted before I even got there.  I was happy to have to take home a doggie bag, too.  
I got the olives, red goat salad and the mac and cheese.  I will eat anything that includes green chiles in it.  Anything.  A few varieties of olives were served wtih fresh herbs and a dash an oil & vinegar.  I love all olives and don't always buy them for home, so it was a real treat.

Within a a couple of minutes the manager was at our table with an apology and an offer to comp a couple of deserts.  Geez, it was just an errant mushroom!  In fact, the pizza here is very good and they clearly go the extra mile in trying to accommodate their customers.
I was please enough to return the next night with my wife and share a Margarita pizza (which is very good).  Wanting something sweet to finish off our meal, we opted for the chocolate mousse.  While it may not have been the ultimate dessert it was quite good and we enjoyed several bites before deciding we'd had enough to satisfy without adding unnecessarily to our growing waistlines.  Seeing we'd only eaten a bit, the waitress comped the dessert.  We explained we'd been happy with the mousse and were just full but she took it off the bill just the same.

yogurtology has a wide range of excellent flavors of frozen yogurt that seem to rotate daily. i've seen chocolate mint, oreo, cupcake batter, red velvet, chocolate peanut butter, mango, blackberry, oatmeal cookie and vanilla bean, to name a few. each and every one delish. they also seem to always have at least one non-dairy option available...

the toppings are plentiful and varied. choose from fresh fruit, chopped candy bars, m&ms, nuts, baklava, brownies, truffles, cheesecake, sprinkles galore, ginormous marshmallows and gummy candy... i've never seen so many topping options in one place.

staff are very friendly and attentive. a little TOO attentive for my taste, but hey, i'm the kind of person who likes to be left alone unless i ask for help...overall, they rock!

Of course it's warranted, they pissed me off!

Okay you know how they always do BOGOF on milk.. well me and the Mr don't drink that much milk so the cashier usually just gives me half off the 1 gallon. Well this time she forgot to and I didn't notice until I got home.. so seeing that I used to shop here once a week I figured Id just bring my receipt back the following week. Well the following week I went in and showed the receipt and the dumb bitch behind the counter was like, 'what am I supposed to do about it?'.. I explained to her what usually happens as the cashier gives it to me for half off.. she then proceeded to ask me which cashier was doing that, 'it's not our policy.'
After going back and forth for a few minutes I finally just told her to give me my 2 bucks.. she told me if I would have brought them the receipt back the same day they would have done something about it. Are you f-ing kidding me? Whats the difference besides my being inconvenienced having to drive back there. So I finally asked her if she was willing to lose a potential lifetime customer over 2 bucks? She responded, 'there's nothing I can do for you.' I then told her that her customer service skills suck and that I will NEVER return to the store.

We were there late at night- probably for the 2 hours right before closing on a one day sale day. In every single dept. We went (ladies dresses, ladies shoes, men's etc) EVERYONE was soooo nice and helpful. Most of our visit was in ladies dresses. Those reps did everything possible to help us find dresses in different sizes (which can definitely be challenging at the end of a season and at the end of a one day sale when things are haphazardly placed everywhere) and to call other Macy's stores when we were unsuccessful in finding a dress at that location in a particular size. Sure, they wanted a sale, but to be so helpful so late at night, right before closing, after a long one day sale was shocking. We must have encountered at least 10 different sales associates while wondering through the store and each and every one was soooo nice and helpful. The selection (at least in women's) was better than most other Macy's I've been to, to boot. 

I wish this was my local Macy's! Go here- hopefully your experience is just as good as mine :)",2011-09-24
5704,190,2699,"note: the 5 stars i'm giving this place is for their happy hour menu, not the regular menu. if you order off the regular menu no amount of advice can help you.



M&S has to have one of the best happy hours in the world, aside from Spearmint Rhino. $3 drafts and a rotating $2 bar food menu, such as 1/2 lb. burger with fries, hot wings, fish tacos, beef taquitos, etc. don't order the fish chilli though, it tastes like A1 sauce. they got a lot of winners on tap, like kiltlifter, guinness, bass, fat tire, pyramid hefe, etc.



happy hour is from 3p-6p and then again from 9p-11p, which is pure genius. make sure you get your parking ticket balidated, because the Eritrean girl in the parking garage will make you go back in the restaurant and get that joint stamped if you forget. BUZZKILL.",2006-04-23

5785,46,4141,"I love Lux. The new venue is great because there is a lot more room. The only problem is that it's still not enough. This place used to be a great place to just hang and spend the morning on a weekend or weekday. Now it's over crowded and doesn't have that neighborhood feel anymore. Some of the staff is super friendly while others have attitudes. 

The coffee is impeccable and the food is delicious. That first sip of my soy hazelnut latte is always the most delicious and compares to no other coffee. This is what keeps me coming back. 

If you want to sit for a while, make sure you arrive at the right time. And keep in mind the right time is never the same time. You pretty much have to get lucky to find a good spot. I've started getting my coffee to go. Also, they don't open until 7AM. This is when my shift starts, so I can no longer go before work. A great remedy for this was to buy Lux beans and to brew my coffee in a French press each morning. I'm definitely not complaining about the quality. It's still delicious. 

I try to make a visit to Lux at least once a week and will continue to do so....",2012-01-22

The sushi was delicious - quality pieces and very fresh.  My only complaint was the bathroom sink - while very cool looking, the faucets don't work unless you slam the handle in and then the water just sprays out sporadically.

124,116,120,"My husband and I went here on a Saturday night for dinner because we had a restaurant.com gift certificate. Yes, it's in the Sheraton, and yes it's near the airport with not much else around, but I have to say- we were both impressed. 

We started with the Gambas al Fuego, which were deliciously spicy (although I thought that $10 for four shrimp was a bit excessive, no matter how tasty they were). We both had house salads with blue cheese dressing- I think you can tell a lot about the quality of a place by their salads. They used fresh field greens, the tomatoes were perfect and sweet, and even the thinly sliced onions were sweet and delicious. The blue cheese dressing was fantastic, and had actual chunks of blue cheese. I was impressed, for a hotel restaurant. For our entrees, I had the hickory smoked baby back ribs (good, but not phenomenal) and husband ordered the chorizo chicken- I am so glad he shared a bite with me, because it was awesome. I was really wishing I'd gotten that instead of the ribs. Oh, and I especially wanted to mention the asparagus that came with my ribs- tender, cooked just right, and flavorful. This place uses quality ingredients.

If it wasn't so out of the way, we would definitely come by regularly. My husband was especially enticed by the prime rib melt sandwich, so I think we'll be back during lunch in the near future. 

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars was that the atmosphere was pretty dead. Which I suppose is understandable, given that it's inside the Sheraton. The decor was nice though. They should have a free standing restaurant in an area with more traffic- this place would be a hit.",2010-08-15
4055,2092,3087,"I decided to give this place another shot.  This time around I was sober, and thus have actual memories.

After grabbing a drink my friend and I decided to head out to the patio.  A group of 3 guys graciously let us share their table since the place was packed.  A short period later one of the guys pours his drink into the candle holder and storms off.  I made a comment about it being his time of the month and I'm not so sure they appreciated it because they all left.  Although, the most sober of the bunch seemed embarrassed.  Whatever, free table, woohoo!

Next table starts having a beer fight.  I'm not kidding.  

I then started feeling really old.

And overdressed.

An employee comes by to clean up the empty bottles from my table and notices the candle holder full of liquid.  I told him about the guy with PMDD.  He made a little joke about the the guy being upset over my rejection of him.

6048,1600,4297,"This Mexican restaurant has the best burritos in town!  This is not your roach infested 24 hour drive through kind of burrito joint either.  Here are the reasons that make La Tolteca #1 and one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix!

--colorful, tasteful, vibrant ambiance in the country-hacienda style; kudos to the designers with an eye for detail;
--dining room draws natural light from the delightful patio windows to the vaulted ceilings above;
--this place and the adjacent ranch market are a ""must-do"" for tourists (bring your out-of-towners here);

--Don't miss the Parrilla (grilled platter); one ""portion"" serves two; choose three meats and voice your tortilla preference;
--grilled vegetables include nopales (cactus), Mexican zucchini squash, jalapenos (consumed whole, took me to five hiccups before my stomach settled), and baby onion stalks (not the typical pile-o-fajita yellows);
--both rice and beans served family style, and perfectly flavored. I could just sit and eat bowl after bowl of those beans;
--juicy, perfectly cooked shrimp; ""asada"" goodness knows no bounds;
--guacamole is plentiful (no melon-ball scoops of yesterday at $3/ea here!) and freshly made to order; NOW THAT'S what I'm TALKing about !!!
--table salsa is spicy with lots of freshly chopped chilis and pureed onions; really good burn;
--try the horchata (rice milk and cinnamon sugary goodness) or any of the featured Aguas Frescas.
--no fuss over separate checks (and that was for our table of 10!)

--pork was a bit dry; is ""gamey"" possible in pork?
--server forgot our desserts and we gave up after 20 minutes (shucks! they were sitting right there on the pass!); the manager refunded us promptly and then packaged them to-go.

After so many recent disappointments on rock-hard rubbery shrimp, I _finally_ found a place that grills properly, excellent marinade, and with the freshest ingredients. If you get the impression that you are amidst a food operation staffed by thousands, you are correct: several hundred are working in the kitchens next door making tortillas, cheese, asada, aguas and more!

If you don't have a filthy-rich Mexican relative with a hacienda (Mexican mansion) across the border, this may be the closest you'll get without an invitation. The mostly-abandoned courtyard is centered with a gigantic fountain, lined with what could be booths for a seasonal market, bodas, or other festival. In the corner a lush garden with a somewhat secret door leading to la sala, the grand room.

2047,1455,1710,"The absolute worse service I've encountered. My boyfriend, son and I sat at a tepan table, we were ignored for a good 15-20 minutes until my boyfriend had to ask the manager to please have someone get us something to drink. Once we had our drinks, it took another 20 minutes to order our food. By that time, another family sat at our table. My son & boyfriend ordered a meal from the tepan menu, I had sushi. Everyone on that table got their meal and I still didn't get my sushi. I asked the server to please bring it and she brought someone else's order, I had to wait another 20 minutes for my sushi. The family on our table were so upset for us as well. 

The food is excellent, the service is so poor I am disappointed. I advise anyone who comes here to sit at the sushi bar and deal with the Chefs, they are great. I talked to the owner and she was just as bad as the servers. 

I then gave it another try. I met my girlfriends there. We had dinner, spent over $200. We then moved over to the bar area and were completely forgotten about. We asked the manager/owner to please have someone come take care of us and we were told that they were concerned because we were drinking and had kids with us. One of my girlfriends had her kids but she was not drinking. I was offended that she tried to cover up the poor service with her so-called concern.

6798,3325,3029,"When Fresh & Easy started popping up everywhere, it was my new favorite go to place for quick and easy meals.  They have a great selection of ready made entrees and salads that beat going through the drive through. The fact that there were always excellent coupons to be received could have been a big factor in why I returned so often. Key word, WERE, I think they have lightened up on their coupon circulation!

The problem started when I began to do my actual grocery shopping here.  They have great prices on a limited, but satisfactory, amount of grocery items.  Its the produce and veggies that are troublesome.  I find that they start to go bad after 2 or 3 days, which isn't very convenient or money saving when it means I am throwing half of what I buy away.  I am very conscious of expiration dates on items, and have even found myself throwing away items prior to their expiration.   

So, unless your planning on cooking with your fresh items that day, I would avoid the produce and even some dairy and meat items. So what I am saying is, frozen, dry or canned stuff...I am pretty sure your safe with.

This location in particular has also been my least favorite to visit as far as friendly staff.  I usually have to bag my own groceries....yeah, I know, self checkout keeps the prices down, however, when you have 2 or 3 staff members just hanging out by the registers with little or no people in line, it wouldn't hurt for someone to jump on bagging groceries...its a little customer service that may save someone from not returning!",2010-10-11
3192,108,2516,"This 2 stars is extremely generous. Wanna know why? Read on.

My party of 7 and a baby got to Pappadeux's around 6:30. We were told that it would be a 30-minute wait. It ended up being more than an hour. We were standing right in front of the hostess station, yet no one ever came to give us updates on how long it would be for our table. We would go check about every 20 or so minutes. One time we were told that our table was ready. When we went to check on it after about 20 minutes we were told that they were waiting on a busboy to clean it. A few minutes later they were still waiting on a busboy. In what universe does it take a restaurant 30 minutes to find a busboy to clean a table? We watched group after group after group get seated. A group of 7 that came after us was seated before us. We ended up being sat next to them; by the time we were getting our menus, they were finishing up their meals.

Once we were finally seated, we waited almost 10 minutes before someone came to our table to introduce himself as our waiter. When he asked how we were doing, we kindly told him that we were a little frustrated because it had taken more than twice as long as we were told, and we had been told twice that they were waiting on a busboy to clean the table. The waiter said that it was a busy night and said that he didn't get paid to deal with unhappy customers. He asked, ""So are you gonna do this or what?"" WHAT?! It was so rude - I don't know how he meant it, but it came across as sounding extremely annoyed. We were appalled and my boyfriend asked to speak to a manager.

The manager came over and spoke with my boyfriend. Not sure what was said, but after that things got much better. The manager brought us an appetizer plate on the house. Our food ended up being really good - including the alligator. I got shrimp etoufee, and it was great. The gumbo wasn't so fabulous. Overall, everyone was satisfied with their meal. We got three different drinks, and they basically tasted the same: like cherry Nyquil.

Perhaps the curry is the 'yellow curry' that Jenny R refers to in her review - maybe the chef should taste it before serving it - it was nasty!

Seriously, I've had better Asian food from the food court at the mall before!

I will say, you did listen to my request to add eggplant to the dish - thank you... but if someone requests eggplant, perhaps you should make sure it's cooked fully next time.  I had a bite that was barely cooked - it was crunchy.

367,237,344,"Wow, not what we were expecting at all. But that's a good thing. The restaurant would qualify as a ""Dive"" in most circles, a tiny 20 seat affair with recycled refer units as cabinets located in the corner of a strip mall with a 99 cent store and a BigLots. Not exactly a high-end neighborhood.

But after having heard of this little cafe in The New Times and finding that Phoenix Magazine rated their Ceviche and Shrimp salad as one of the Valley's top 50 dishes, we decided that we must give it a try! The article in New Times raved about something called a Pupusa and description sounded familiar, once we were there I realized why.

Every culture on earth seems to have developed some form of stuffed hand pie. You know the formula, a regional bread or pastry dough, formed into a pocket and stuffed with savory or sweet fillings. Food on the go. Well in El Salvador it's called a Pupusa, and they were delicious!

A kind of thick corn tortilla type bread, filled with several different types of  fillings, pork and cheese, beans, chicken and cheese, beef and cheese or beef, bean and cheese.

Now this is NOT your typical Arizona/Mexican food. The cheese is a freshly made cheese that is a Salvadoran tradition and is one of the best fresh cheeses I have ever had, smooth and soft yet very flavourful. The tortilla is not what you might be used to either, they are corn tortillas but they are not the course chip like corn tortillas so prevalent in Americanized Hispanic foods. They are thick, soft and delicious. It is this tortilla that is the basis of their Pupusas.

Don't expect to find the standard ""Mexican Restaurant"" re-fried beans here either. Spicy, flavourful and smooth, having been mashed right after cooking, they are among the best example of simple yet wonderful tastes you will experience here.

We had some of all of the different Pupusas offered on the menu which are priced very reasonable indeed, and were impressed with all of them, though the pork and cheese and the bean were my personal favorites.

We also had a corn tamale that was sweet and moist and tasty, rolled in a banana leaf instead of the corn husk we are used to. Perhaps that is why it was so much more moist than your average corn tamale.

To finish off our repast we enjoyed the fried plantains, actually an appetizer on the menu, they were crispy on the outside and starchy and tasty inside. Served with freshly made salsa and the Salvadoran version of Crème Fraîche that was also a hit.

The owner was our server and I am still not sure she spoke much English, but she was very nice to us and the orders were always right. As well as very very hot! I had to let my Pupusas sit a few minutes before they were cool enough to consume, and a word of warning, Plantains retain heat even better than potatoes do so proceed carefully.

As I've said the Ceviche and Shrimp salad is an award winner and the Carne Asada that the folks at the next table had ordered looked delicious. However I could not ask their opinion as they did not seem to speak English either and my Spanish is worse than terrible. But they seemed to be enjoying it, I'll give it a try next time.

They serve breakfast too and I can hardly wait to give that a try as well.

Stop in, you'll be glad you did.",2009-06-05

It is a very clean establishment, and the staff was super welcoming and friendly. I am not a huge fan of barbecue, but my pulled pork sandwich was amazing, as well as the warm cornbread I got on the side. Kevin got something similar with some spicy sausage or something. I didn't care for his, mostly because I don't like spicy things, but he enjoyed it. I think the food and the staff is worth between 4 and 5 stars, but OMG the music. Nothing but really lame jazz and 90's soul music. Each song was progressively worse than the last, and I kid you not - Brian McKnight came on and I just about lost it.

2925,1911,676,"OK, I went based on Tim C.'s Yelp review of this place, and I am so glad I did. I rode my bike up there around 1PM Wednesday afternoon, and I have to say I was not disappointed. 

Even though it was hot out, the outdoor table was surprisingly cool and comfortable. I got an iced soy latte and it was so good. I don't know how to explain it, but there is great tasting espresso and there is bland espresso. This place just has great tasting espresso. I found out while I was there that Ted (the guy who made it) had roasted the beans himself. You can buy the beans from them if you are one of those industrious people who grind and brew your own espresso drinks...I am not. I prefer to leave that to the professionals.  He actually ground the espresso when I ordered my drink. If you get the chance please go see what I am talking about. You will notice how much better the espresso is.

The place itself is so beautiful and relaxing. If you sit outside like I did, you are basically sitting in a big outdoor garden. It is kept cool by the overhead canopy and the swamp cooler air blowing out from inside the coffee shop. Ted was really friendly, I felt comfortable just hanging out for a while reading my book. Unfortunately, the coffee shop closes at 2 PM, otherwise I bet it would be beautiful at night. This place definitely looks like something that would be in a cool little town somewhere, and  not off of a busy street like Hayden Rd. 

Ted also told me he makes the lemonade himself fresh squeezed, something I love and will definitely try. When I go back, I think I will go a bit earlier.  I may do a bit of plant shopping as well while I am there...

2165,356,387,"I violated my rule of avoiding grocery shopping while hungry and decided to venture over to Whole Foods.  Whole Foods tends to be the indecisive individual's nightmare (that would be me).  Yet, this store is a foodie's dream. 

There are aisles upon aisles of glorious, wholesome products (pun intended).  Everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item.  No joke.  It took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable (and economical). 

I roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's prey...strategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation.  Did I want a made-to-order wrap?  Or a glass of wine and a couple tapas? (the live music was alluring)...Maybe sushi?  Pizza?  Salad bar?  Soup? Maybe something from the smokehouse...oooh! A cupcake from the cupcake bar? 

On and on it went. 

My final decision was sushi. The spicy tuna roll tasted fresh, and the Pacific salad roll was very crisp. I also grabbed a container of ginger for $1.99--not the artificially preserved pink variety--all-natural pickled ginger.  Bliss.  I purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side/palate cleanser. All in all, a very satisfying meal.

5360,700,3901,"I have to admit: I am impressed.

I have been to a few vegan-only-menu restaurants and I was... underwhelmed. Nothing against the raw food movement, but unless it is a raw-specific place, I expect more creativity. Show me what food can do, be, taste like. Don't just cut it up and toss it on a plate.

Four of us came in to eat on a Saturday and the place was PACKED. A good sign, surely, AND it was a really great mix of demographics: young and old, many nationalities, singles, couples, families... we liked that it had a wide appeal.

The place smelled fantastic, too, so we started perusing the menu long before we had a table to sit at. We waited about ten minutes for a table. It's a bit like a cafeteria in that you order and pay at the counter, and the food is brought to your table.

While we waited we were given a bowl of the ""house soup"" which, basically, was warm carrot water with a piece of carrot or two and some tiny, tiny mushrooms. We all agreed that it needed more of a broth flavor (more types of veg? more mushrooms?), but it was tasty enough and definitely whet our appetites for more.

The spring rolls were really good but needed more. As we removed the peanuts for my friend, I ""blame"" this on us... I will have to have them with the peanuts next time.

The crispy rolls were spiced and savory and light and perfectly crispy. 

My favorite had to be the Pate Chaude. Flaky, savory with a bite from a wonderful combination of spices, and a meatiness from the mushrooms that made us think a die-hard carnivore in our lives may not miss the meat if he were to eat it. THE dish of the day, hands down.

The curries were a bit bland (Save-Planet and Divine Curry Noodles). They were fine, OK, but nothing that made us think we'd come just for that. Much better elsewhere.

The Gracious Spicy Noodle soup was really tasty but it needed a tad more spice. With spicy in the name, we expected more. 

Some stuff is pretty basic: the sushi rolls are basic veggie sushi rolls. The rainbow salad is a tasty but commonplace cabbage and carrot slaw. The fried rice was fried rice. All yummy, all fine to eat, but nothing spectacular, different, or altogether exciting. Basic isn't bad.

Four stars for the surprising and amazing pate chaude and the rolls, for sure. Ideally, 3.5 stars this trip, but I rounded up for the good parts. 

Couldn't go five stars for two reasons: too many items were just basic and the service is slooooooooow. 20+ minutes for fried rice (that we had to ask about)? 25+ minutes for some soup? It was a crap shoot as to what was going to be delivered and when. While they were swamped when we came in, the crowd was thinning out for their afternoon down time (they close from 3p-5p). Overall, our lunch took over 2 hours, most of it waiting on dishes to come out. No bueno if you have other plans that day.

So... tasty, some major standouts, some ""meh, I've had this before."" We *WILL* absolutely go back to give the menu more of a chance to wow us; the ones that knocked us off our feet are worth the return. (Hopefully it's delivered a little faster this time!).",2012-09-17

Since it was lunch time, it was not busy at all. Nothing is worse that being on your work lunch, starving, and standing in line. I opted for the Chicken Walnut Sandwich, with a cup of Tomato Soup. 

The sandwich was delicious and fresh. The bread was perfect as was the chicken walnut salad. You know...sometimes chicken salad can get really gross..slimey..salty...yucky. This one was perfect and the walnuts added a delicious crunch.

On to the soup. First off, I L-O-V-E tomato soup. It is my favorite. Would almost consider taking a bath in it. Hehehe...well, ok maybe not. BUT this soup rocked my socks off. Perfectly creamy, with a hint of smoky flavor, a small drizzle of sour cream and a few crunchy tortilla strips. YUM.

So, venture there to try the soup but scurry fast and take the food with you. Don't eat there. Take it somewhere, where you can have a moment alone with the soup.

Can you please get your crap together and win some games (similar to last night) so Phoenicians will like you and you can finally build a fan base?  

While I half-enjoyed watching you spank the St. Louis Rams yesterday in the last game of the season, while scoring the most points in a Cardinals game since the 1970s, you still suffer from mediocrity.  Your win against the lowly Rams was hardly inspiring since that team completely sucks. AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, can you please beat the piece-of-crap 49ers?!?!

You remind me of a nouveau riche socialite with no manners.  You have a beautiful expensive abode, but still seem like you're from the wrong side of the tracks.  Please tell your owners to stop being so cheap, beef up your roster, spend a little dough and take some risks and the ever-elusive glory years might be around the corner.

Last night, a jaded and cynical fan of yours told my friends (in Rams jerseys) in the parking lot, ""Thanks for sucking today.  WE usually suck and all, but your team was much worse.""

6,6,6,"Quiessence is, simply put, beautiful.  Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.

My friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.

For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.

The entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.

If the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.",2007-12-13

5300,660,3870,"Lovely shop, great cupcake selection, friendly service.  But the real question is...how do the cupcakes taste???  Pretty good.  I tried (4) flavors and they ranged from OK to YUMMMMMM!  Vanilla with chocolate buttercream was ok, the Coconut was good (a bit dry, but decent flavor), the Carrot was very good, and the Mocha was YUMMMMMM!   They were all super sweet though.  My husband and I both had a quarter of each flavor and that was more than enough.  

From a flavor variety and taste perspective, Sprinkles is a 3.5 - 4.  However, I really can't justify spending $14.00 for (4) cupcakes.  They are expensive so they can pay their overhead and lease costs, not because of exotic ingredients or special decorating skills.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure they use good ingredients, but the wrappers are plain, there's no special piping or fondant work, and the flavors are standard. They are just plain good cupcakes...not fantastic, but good.  Certainly not worth $3.50 a cupcake.  I do a ton of baking and I get special order requests from friends and neighbors all the time.  I always do nice decorating and use premium ingredients and the most I charge is $2.00 a cupcake...and that's only if I use fondant.",2012-08-13

I also opted for the special that evening which was a tenderloin sandwich with poblano, swiss, watercress, and charred onion.  While the poblano and onion sold me on it, I didn't quite get the swiss and watercress.  It was good, but could have been better with another cheese IMHO.  Also tried the herbed fries (delicious) and the mac 'n cheese (not as delicious).  The mac 'n cheese was good, but lacked the gooey cheesiness I crave.  We finished with warm doughnuts and salted butterscotch.  Doughnuts were fantastic, and it's hard not to like the butterscotch, but the ""salted"" part was missing.  A touch more please.

But there is just nothing like their fresh food.  Be it produce or the meat section, the colors are brighter, the items are bigger and you just know it's going to taste better.  Their chicken breasts and pork chops are so amazingly good, and so large, you want to eat them all at once, but you just can't.  You have to try some of their pre-prepped meats.  My fav is a pork loin with apple stuffing.  Wow. 

And of course, great pre-made foods too if you just want to pick up something to go.  I've been suckered in to their desert section far too many times.  And they are always good.  But dang they can be pricy - so it really has to just be a special splurge.  

If you haven't tried an AJ's yet, I suggest this one to ease you into things.   There may be quite a few Lexus in the parking lot, but there won't be too many Hummers.",2007-03-31
6977,145,2204,"I feel bad giving them a mediocre rating but I'm reviewing what's in their NAME. I drove about 9 miles across Gilbert (that is quite a chore) because I wanted to serve good roast beef sandwiches for dinner and I needed good bread. 

I had Boar's Head roast beef, tomatoes, horseradish sauce, avocado, roasted red peppers etc I just needed great bread. Where else in Gilbert should I go? I did a Yelp search and it agreed - to this place. 

I arrived around 4:15 and the pickings were slim. I got the last round of sourdough and a small nine grain. I asked her to slice thick, she walked to the slicer and said it has one setting. Okay I'll slice myself. 

Because I love Cupcakes I also took a chocolate cupcake and my boys got a chewy brownie each. The total was about $16. 

We got home the bread was hard (both) soft on the deep inside so I had to grill the sandwiches with butter not my plan but it's butter, butter fixes everything. 

The cupcake frosting was good I ate the top threw away the 'cup' not worth the calories. I only allowed the boys to eat half the brownie each and save the other half for tomorrow as they were huge. The said they were really good. 

Basically, I'll buy my bread at the grocery store or at Paradise bakery as the wasted gas and time in the car was not worth it.",2011-07-27
6791,591,4728,"Went here for dinner on a Saturday night.  Put our names in...and only had to wait about 30 min. Not too bad. The bar was a little too crowded to wait there, so we went a couple of doors down to pass our time.

On to dinner...we had a great server.  He was super friendly, nice and was vocal with his opinions.  I would love to tell you that all of his reccs were spot on...but they weren't.

We started with the pretzels and the cheese fondue. DELISH.  I went halfsies with my friend and we shared the prime rib sammie and the shrimp caesar salad.  The prime rib sammie was mediocre.  The beef wasn't flavored at all, and when we got the fries, they were cold.  Hot plate, cold food..not a good sign.

We did get fresh fries, I didn't finish my half, and moved on to the salad.  The salad was good, but not great.

All in all, I would go for a drink and some apps, but wouldn't really want to eat dinner here again.  I may have just ordered wrong...but two meh things do it for me.",2010-05-11

Nam Sao is the best. The guy always working and seeming to make the food is so quick and super sweet. Great service, my drink never goes empty, and the table is set in traditional pho-joint style: a metal caddy with spoons, forks [...], chopsticks, napkins, and all the delicious condiments.

The menu is enormous, so if you happen to be in the mood for something other than their glorious, never-watered-down noodle soup, you can try something else. The spring rolls, I love them. The boba tea is great too, I've had it thicker and more rich at Pho Hoa in Oly but I like the less creamy variety served at Nam Sao. 

Fast service, cheap filling meal, wonderful server.. I literally cannot think of anything bad to say about Nam Sao, except it's so small it's kind of hard to find if you're new to the spot.

Update:

Went for lunch:   This time I thought the corned beef taquitos even  better than last, curry chips tad saltier.  Still loving the appetizers and the cider.  This time had the  cottage pie,  it's  really nothing to write home about, specially if you are from the region and your parent's wouldn't appreciate you seeing other cottage pies;)    Spend the extra on the sheperds  it's really much better.   This was ok , really really nothing special and the heat could have been better.   Service  is good, but pedestrian , the last time I had no time pressure, this time I did.     We're sitting at 3.5 - 3.75 now with the round up till 4. Still  I'll return
 

Original Review:
 First thanks to Julie P for pointing out that this place exists. That it's within stumbling distance of the house ( think prolonged zombie stumble over an hour  versus a quick trip and recover)  is even better. 
Cider on tap is Strongbow and you get it in a real pint., Yay.  Sadly that's all they have and there's no bottled ones to try ,  Strongbow is  the Bud of UK ciders and while it's way better than no cider or what passes for beer here it's not that hard to stock more of a common drink for a themed bar. 

Onto the Food  (I'll get to it as a venue some other time)  
Appetizers.  Curry and chips was exactly what it should have been  and a generation of Irish and UK kids have  grown up with this for lunch  at the local chip shop.   
 
The  corned beef and cabbage taquitos  I think  are moving up to be our #1 appetizer that's not a hot wing. Taste of these  and the hot mustart / tomatillo salsa on the base compliment each other nicely. Not heavy on the fat and delightfully  crunchy.  For once an Irish restaurant trying to do something other than name US staples with cute regional names. 

Main: Salad   and the sheperd's pie. Let's not get into the salad it's a waste of time reviewing vegetables.  The pie is pretty good and none of the flavours overwhelm each other. Not sure the champ ( mashed potatos ) atop them live up to what lies below but it's more a personal texture issue than it spoiled the overall dish.  

Bread and Butter pudding is really good but please if you have any trouble sleeping after reading nutrition sheets as to the fat and carb content of your meal DON'T just  eat it and run round the  block four times before getting back in the car. 

Oddity?    parsley flakes on all the plates to make it green , please just buy green speckled plates , it's classier:D  At the end got a coupon for 25% off the next bill which I will certainly take them up on. It's as good  for food as any of the valley's Irish bars ( better imho)  but have to get back on pub quiz night  to really know.

Were in too early to hear the band but you can look at the pa, the space and  know it's going to sound  bad ( place looks like standing wave city)  with anything electric and full drum set.

237,219,224,"Yes, the view is wonderful. Absolutely. 

Sadly, my table was near the entrance, limiting my ability to enjoy said view. Also, we are still in the summer months, so I was confused that there was a fire raging outside at night. 

The decor is wonderful, dark with different tones and moods. We arrived in the early evening, so I was surprised to see how dark the room would eventually become. I didn't find the table and its decor that exciting, but it will give it a pass. Not everything has to be practical art.

Our party consisted of five and we were certainly treated to a good sampling of what this place had to offer. Half of the party ordered off of the set price menu. This included a three course meal for something like fifty dollars. It may have even been less than that, but I'm not sure. This menu had an array of choices and wasn't limited to chicken or pork. 

I was impressed with the portions and the quality. The salads were crisp and the dressing wasn't overpowering, more of an accent, the way it should be. The meat was tender and flavorful; our table ordered the NY, Ribeye and Salmon. I do agree with others who said that the sides were a little small, but I do think they were worth the price. I know for sure the cream of corn was, as it was treated with green chili and a bit of spice. 

The desert was alright. Not a great deal of variety. The textures were spot on, but the temperatures seems a bit off. If a dish was intended to be served warm, it was slightly too cold, etc.

The service was bad. Probably the worst service I've had at any restaurant. Our server left items off of the tab, forcing her to return and run the debit card three separate times. I am okay with someone making a mistake, but it should not take two attempts to correct. Also, my wife and I ordered Mojitos. They were very average. No sugar, which I assumed was standard fare for Mojiots, and amount of mint was rather low. I understand that drinks are open to a bartender's whim, so I won't dwell on this fact.

Valet had a bit of trouble with our car and keys, which was annoying.

They do have sweet potato fries that you can order, big plus. 

Service has always been great, they are really quick with getting drink orders in and served to you. I've ordered a bunch of items from salads to fish tacos, and of course, their burgers.

3326,189,495,"When you specialize in something, then you should know it and do it well. This is the Zinburger approach to burgers. Our server, besides being very attentive and friendly, was also extremely knowledgeable about the preparation and ingredients. It showed me that Zinburger really knows their burgers and takes the time to educate their staff. It also served to heighten my expectations...which weren't let down.

The quality of my burger was very apparent. The bun was fresh, the meat was high grade, and the other ingredients were also well thought out. I love when restaurants are meticulous with their creations. This is a superb burger, expertly prepared from the creation of the patty (not too compressed) to the cooking of it (a perfectly pink in the middle ""medium"" is what I ordered and received). Simply great.

The milkshakes are over-the-top rich and delicious--like eating whole pint of Haagen Dazs. We all shared one, and it was still overkill. Great tasting though.

The fries were a little ""meh"" to me. Not sure why. They were hot & fresh, but a little bland. I tried the Truffle Fries as well, and they were also a little boring. Maybe they should try a different kind of oil or potato...or both. They were decent fries, just not as ""top notch"" good as the burgers.

Lastly, for a ""burger joint,"" the service was excellent...to the point of fine dining type pampering. Very nice. Overall, I'm a fan. I'm looking forward to returning.",2011-11-19

I don't even like Salmon and theirs is good. Good salad bar and salads ( pasta, tuna etc..) The pizza and sushi.. again amazing!! And........ they have about 10 different iced teas to choose from. Also, they have a great breakfast. Omelet station and all. I suggest the chorizo and egg burritos. GREAT outside patio",2011-10-12

3340,2103,2613,"New N. Scottsdale location, Baaaaaaad!  The were 10 staff members milling around and there was no manager on sight.  $10.00 for a mediocre burger, with an uncooked, tasteless bun not large enough to encompass all the arugula.  They forgot the sauce, which apparently is the main ingredient.  The upgrades are ridiculous.  $1.00 here for cheese on an already ""well priced"" burger (btw Flemings blue cheese/bacon burger $6, best in town), $5,00 here for fries.  C'mon.  And, it's the same two hispanic guys, who don't have any idea about chef inspired food, cooking in the kitchen as every other restaurant, there is no chef For the price, you want to see the chef/owner representing, especially at a new location, and, you want competent staff who treats you as #1, and not their conversing with the other staff members as #1, and you want to enjoy what is supposed to be one of the best burgers in town!  What a disappointment.  The lack of top down management care and supervision carries through in all elements of the poor experience.  Take a pass.",2012-12-20

Richard Cho not only has some of the best customer service skills I have ever seen (that guy has an amazing memory for names) but some of the most creative approaches to making Sushi in the valley. I love coming to Sushi Eye, I have never had a bad experience in all the years I have been going to the 2x New times Best of Phoenix award winner.

The use of Macadamia nuts is brilliant and an amazing addition to many of the creative rolls that are available. The Spicy scallop roll is a go to for sure. They have (and I know this sounds stupid) the BEST California rolls in Arizona. As pedestrian as that roll is, The California roll is transformed in to a very dessert style treat when ordered at Sushi Eye. Seriously, do it.

Go check it out, introduce yourself to Richard and be amazed when he remembers your name. You will be amazed by the food as well.",2010-04-06

I like Sportsman's because it's a friendly and warm atmosphere and they have a great variety of discounts for their different levels of alcohol. The walls are lined from the floor to the ceiling with every type of alcohol. The prices range from $10 - thousands of dollars! It's pretty easy to find any type of brand here. Since it's the holiday season, they are currently offering sales on several of their high-end brands which makes it easy to visit for the purchase of a gift! I also like the fact that guests can visit the intimate bar area and sip on some beverages to take a break from shopping. They also make customized gift baskets!",2012-12-04

The CB&CB burger with tater tots really hit the spot for lunch.  The burger and carmelized onions worked together really well.  The tater tots were delicious.

also, on the special menu right now there's a salad called the mediteranian chicken salad, which really truly may be the most incredible salad i've ever eaten in my life.  i wish i could drink the dressing that topped the impressive mix of greens, corn, roasted red peppers, cilantro, raisins, pine nuts, red onions, parsley, well-seasoned chicken, and i can't remember the rest.  omg.  beautiful.

The food was alright-we ordered the Spicy Chicken Fajitas, the Bacon Chicken Quesadilla and started off with the Onion and Jalapeno Stack. The jalapenos were lame but everything else tasted great after a long day at work.

What was not so great was the service. Two waiters introduced themselves (I figured one was training) but neither bothered to stop by and fill up our drinks or really check in. The girl who served us seemed to spend most of her time on the other side of the dining room and the teen host actually ended up being the one to refill my Strawberry Lemonade.

1384,8,1197,"Sky Harbor is one poor gateway to the city of Phoenix and the Valley of the Sun.  It is outdated, super crowded, it feels dirty and it is the home of US Airways, the biggest carrier in and out of this airport.

Terminal 4 is configured rather poorly.  The terminal reminds me of a backwards E, like the second E in EMIN3M, except that there is another prong to the backwards E.  The concourses are not spacious at all, the seating limited, and consequently the crowds spill out into the walkway areas.
.  
To go from one end of Terminal 4 to the other necessitates using really narrow moving walkways which are on the spine of the E.  It is really hard to maneuver if you want to pass the throngs given the limited space.  The distances are long, the bruises will be many, either to you but most likely given by you as you negotiate your way between flights.

The other thing that must be mentioned is that Sky Harbor is not a business person's airport but rather a tourist airport.  I think that contributes a lot to the chaos.  When an airport is full of amateurs, like Sky Harbor, there are bottlenecks of humanity in all the wrong places.  Further exacerbating the tourist nature of this airport are the snowbirds who flock here so that they can seek skin cancer in all months of the year, not just summer in their native habitats of the Upper Midwest.

Get going on the remodel since it is long overdue and make sure you take in mind the tourists and the business traveler when updating this airport.",2012-09-05

We stumbled upon him and had him come to the house to fix a ceiling fan that had fallen out of the ceiling completely. Yikes... His charge was reasonable for coming by about $40ish and he really goes above and beyond especially with quality and letting you know the facts. 

This was a house full of girls and often times when they are clueless they try to pull a fast one, NOPE, not Duane. He is honest, and very caring. When he was leaving he noticed the door had a stick to it and brought back something from his vehicle and fixed it for free!

Most recently, my girlfriend called him at nearly 9pm to tell him her disposal stopped working. He immediately remembered her as the house with the three dental students and exactly where she lived (even though he had last been there a year ago) and walked her through how to fix it over the phone, for free.

Mainly, I like zuma because the bartenders and staff are always very nice and accommodating. I never have to wait for a drink with them and very often they are pretty giving with generously poured drinks and occasionally a free shot or two for myself and my friends. They also have a fabulous ladies night on Wednesdays where they have free food and champagne for girls (yes, it's not fair boys complain complain complain but you guys get plenty of perks in other industries!).

I'm glad I had the experience, but I don't see where the benefit to this is, at all. It isn't more cost-effective than going to the grocery for frozen pizza, and it isn't that much better than frozen.

On the plus side, the gal at the counter that made my pizzas was very nice, but it's a shame I don't see this kind of business surviving. I probably won't return, I am pretty disappointed.",2011-09-17

33,33,32,"Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas, and their service has been great all the time), I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!

I came home and actually brushed my teeth immediately, it was so bad!  My husband had the Pollo Cubano, which was equally underwhelming and nothing that we could not make at home ourselves.

9358,70,6102,"My vintage shopping in the Phoenix area has been disappointing so far. Goodwill, Salvation Army, and Savers are in their separate boat of cheap stuff that is rarely vintage.  Buffalo Exchange shouldn't even be called vintage, because it is not. 

It is much more of a consignment store. Most of the things are new (or lightly worn) and are cheaper than retail prices but more expensive than Goodwill. The selection really isn't bad. I have found a few things here I am really happy with. 

Example: A sweet pair of orange high heels from Steve Madden I think. (I don't really give a crap about brand names, I buy things because I like em, no matter the name). They were thirty bones (not too cheap) but probably a lot less than they would have been at the mall (I am guessing, 60?).

Its still a fun store despite the vintage confusion. Everyone who works there I think gets all the good clothes first because they are always so freakin' adorable! Super friendly (not the fake kind either, can you believe someone is f*cking the handshake in this metropolis?). 

So get over there. You will find some good stuff. Just don't even bother selling anything unless it is high end brand name or the best vintage find you have ever gotten (and that one is even not a guarantee).",2007-08-02
